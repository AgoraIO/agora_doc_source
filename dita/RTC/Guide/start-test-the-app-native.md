# Test your app

To test your app, follow the steps:

1. Fill in the `appId` and `token` parameters with the App ID and temporary token that you retrieve from Agora Console. Fill `channelName` with the channel name that you use to generate the temporary token.
1. Connect [device] to your computer, and click [run-button] on your [ide]. A moment later you will see the project installed on your device.
1. When the app launches, you should be able to see [view].
1. Ask a friend to join the [feature] with you on the [demo app](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html). Enter the same App ID and channel name.

 <p props="video">After your friend joins the channel, you should be able to see and hear each other.</p>
 <p props="live lives">If your friend joins as a host, you should be able to see and hear each other; if as an audience member, you should only be able to see yourself while your friend can see and hear you.</p>
