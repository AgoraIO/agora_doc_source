# Thread Messages

Threads enable users to create a separate conversation from a specific message within a chat group to keep the main chat uncluttered.

This page shows how to use the Agora Chat SDK to send, receive, recall, and retrieve thread messages in your app.

## Understand the tech

The Agora Chat SDK provides the `ChatManager`, `ChatMessage`, and `ChatMessageThread` classes for thread messages, which allows you to implement the following features:

- Send a thread message
- Receive a thread message
- Recall a thread message
- Retrieve a thread message

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- You have initialized the Agora Chat SDK. For details, see [Get Started with React Native](./agora_chat_get_started_rn).
- You understand the call frequency limit of the Agora Chat APIs supported by different pricing plans as described in [Limitations](./agora_chat_limitation).
- You understand the number of threads and thread members supported by different pricing plans as described in [Pricing Plan Details](./agora_chat_plan).

## Implementation

This section describes how to call the APIs provided by the Agora Chat SDK to implement thread features.

### Send a thread message

Sending a thread message is similar to sending a message in a chat group. The difference lies in the `isChatThread` field, as shown in the following code sample:

```typescript
// Sets `targetId` to the ID of the chat group that receives the message.
// Sets `content` to the message content.
// Sets `chatType` to a group chat as a thread that belongs to a chat group.
// Sets `isChatThread` to `true` to mark this message as a thread message.
ChatMessage message = ChatMessage.createTextMessage(targetId, content, chatType, {isChatThread});
// Implements `ChatMessageCallback` to listen for the message sending event.
const callback = new ChatMessageCallback();
// Sends the message.
ChatClient.getInstance()
  .chatManager.sendMessage(message, callback)
  .then(() => {
    // Prints the log here if the method call succeeds.
    console.log("send message operation success.");
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    // Prints the log here if the method call fails.
    console.log("send message operation fail.", reason);
  });
```

For more information about sending a message, see [Send Messages](./agora_chat_send_receive_messages_rn#send-a-message).


### Receive a thread message

Once a thread has a new message, all chat group members receive the `ChatMessageEventListener#onChatMessageThreadUpdated` callback. Thread members can also listen for the `ChatMessageEventListener#onMessagesReceived` callback to receive thread messages, as shown in the following code sample:

```typescript
// Inherits and implements `ChatMessageEventListener`.
class ChatMessageEvent implements ChatMessageEventListener {
  // Occurs when a message is received.
  onMessagesReceived(messages: ChatMessage[]): void {
    console.log(`onMessagesReceived: `, messages);
  }
  // Occurs when the thread has a new message.
  onChatMessageThreadUpdated(msgThread: ChatMessageThreadEvent): void {
    console.log(`onChatMessageThreadUpdated: `, msgThread);
  }
}
// Adds the message listener.
const listener = new ChatMessageEvent();
ChatClient.getInstance().chatManager.addMessageListener(listener);
// Removes the message listener.
ChatClient.getInstance().chatManager.removeMessageListener(listener);
// Removes all the message listeners.
ChatClient.getInstance().chatManager.removeAllMessageListener();
```

For more information about receiving a message, see [Receive Messages](./agora_chat_send_receive_messages_rn#receive-the-message).


### Recall a thread message

For details about how to recall a message, refer to [Recall Messages](./agora_chat_send_receive_messages_rn#recall-a-message).

Once a message is recalled in a thread, all chat group members receive the `ChatMessageEventListener#onChatMessageThreadUpdated` callback. Thread members can also listen for the `ChatMessageEventListener#onMessagesRecalled` callback, as shown in the following code sample:

```typescript
// Inherits and implements `ChatMessageEventListener`.
class ChatMessageEvent implements ChatMessageEventListener {
  // Occurs when a message is recalled.
  onMessagesRecalled(messages: ChatMessage[]): void {
    console.log(`onMessagesRecalled: `, messages);
  }
  // Occurs when a thread message is recalled.
  onChatMessageThreadUpdated(msgThread: ChatMessageThreadEvent): void {
    console.log(`onChatMessageThreadUpdated: `, msgThread);
  }
}
```


### Retrieve thread messages from the server
