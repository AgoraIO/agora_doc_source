# Cross-border dedicated proxy

With the development of economic globalization and the advancement of Internet technologies, cross-border dedicated proxy is indispensable for many enterprises as it can help enterprises better cope with the pressure of international competition and expand overseas markets. In order to improve the instant messaging experience of enterprises conducting global business, Agora has set up dedicated lines from the Chinese mainland to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong to Chinese mainland, to meet the communication needs of end users in the Chinese mainland and other regions. Online education enterprises are typical cases, where teachers and students tend to be located in different countries and regions. For example, American teachers teach English courses to Chinese students through online videos, enabling the dedicated proxy can greatly improve the use experience of Agora Chat.
