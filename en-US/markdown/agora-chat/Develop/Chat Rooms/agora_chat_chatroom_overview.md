Chat rooms enable real-time messaging among multiple users and are widely applied in live broadcast use cases as stream chat in Twitch.. Chat rooms do not have a strict membership, and members do not retain any permanent relationship with each other. Once a chat room member goes offline, this member does not receive any push messages from the chat room and automatically leaves the chat room in two minutes. If you want to adjust the time, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io).

## Chat room roles and privileges

Chat rooms have the following roles and privileges:

- Chat room members: Members can send and receive chat room messages. 
- Chat room admins: Admins are appointed by the chat group owner. Apart from sending and receiving chat room messages, admins have some administrative privileges. Chat rooms can be configured to have up to 99 admins.
- Chat room owner: When a user creates a chat room, they automatically become the owner. Owners have the most privileges in a chat room, including appointing admins, modifying chat room attributes, and managing other chat room members (including admins). Owners can also disband the chat room or transfer ownership to another member.

## Chat groups vs. chat rooms

Chat groups and chat rooms both support instant messaging among multiple users. However, chat groups typically have a more consistent membership than chat rooms. Chat group users are normally connected to the group itself; chat room users are more likely to be connected by their interest in the subject of the chat room, and so they tend to join and leave more freely.

The specific feature differences are listed in the following table:

| Feature    | Chat group   | Chat room     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use cases  | Group chat scenarios in Signal and Skype, where members have a preexisting relationship with each other. | Stream chat scenarios in Twitch, where viewers have no relationship with each other. Once a member quits the stream channel, they leave the chat room.  |
| Maximum number of members | 5,000 | 20,000+  |
| Message push support | Members receive push messages when they go offline. | Members do not receive push messages when they go offline. |
| Message storage support | Supports message storage when a member is offline. Once online, this member receives all the stored messages. A maximum number of 200 messages can be stored for each group chat thread.   | This feature can be enabled and disabled. If you enable this feature, the SDK supports message storage when a member is offline. Once online, this member receives all the stored messages. By default, 10 messages can be stored for each chat room thread, and you can set this number to a maximum value of 200. |
| Message reliablity | All members receive all the messages in the chat group. | Members might not see all messages. The SDK discards messages if the chat group message threshold is exceeded. The default threshold is 100 messages per second. You can adjust this threshold according to your needs.  |

## Chat room features

You can implement the following features with the chat room APIs:


### Create a chat room

Only the [chat room super admin](./agora_chat_restful_chatroom_superadmin) can create a chat room, and the user that creates the chat room becomes the chat room owner. The maximum number of chat room members supported varies according to the pricing plan. For details, see [Limitations of chat room](#limitations).
