Chat rooms enable real-time messaging among multiple users.

This page shows how to use the Agora Chat SDK to manage the attributes of a chat room in your app.


## Understand the tech

The Agora Chat SDK provides the `ChatRoom`, `ChatRoomManager`, and `ChatRoomEventHandler` classes for chat room management, which allows you to implement the following features:

- Retrieve the announcements of a chat room
- Update the announcements of a chat room
- Update the name of a chat room
- Update the description of a chat room


## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- You have initialized the Agora Chat SDK. For details, see [Get Started with Flutter](./agora_chat_get_started_flutter).
- You understand the call frequency limit of the Agora Chat APIs supported by different pricing plans as described in [Limitations](./agora_chat_limitation).
- You understand the number of chat rooms supported by different pricing plans as described in [Pricing Plan Details](./agora_chat_plan).


## Implementation

This section describes how to call the APIs provided by the Agora Chat SDK to implement chat room features.

### Retrieve the chat room announcements

All chat room members can call `fetchChatRoomAnnouncement` to retrieve the chat room announcements.

The following code sample shows how to retrieve the chat room announcements:

```dart
try {
  String? announcement =
      await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.fetchChatRoomAnnouncement(
    roomId,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Update the chat room announcements

Only the chat room owner and admins can call `updateChatRoomAnnouncement` to set and update the announcements. The length of the chat room announcements can be a maximum of 512 characters. Once the chat room announcements are updated, all the other chat room members receive the `ChatRoomEventHandler#onAnnouncementChangedFromChatRoom` callback.

The following code sample shows how to update the chat room announcements:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.updateChatRoomAnnouncement(
    roomId,
    newAnnouncement,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Update the chat room name

The chat room owner and admins can call `changeChatRoomName` to set and update the chat room name. The length of a chat room name can be a maximum of 128 characters.

The following code sample shows how to update the chat room name:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.changeChatRoomName(
    roomId,
    newName,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Update the chat room description

The chat room owner and admins can call `changeChatRoomDescription` to set and update the chat room description. The length of a chat room description can be a maximum of 512 characters.

The following code sample shows how to update the chat room description:

```dart
try {
  await ChatClient.getInstance.chatRoomManager.changeChatRoomDescription(
    roomId,
    newDesc,
  );
} on ChatError catch (e) {
}
```

### Listen for chat room events
