## Overview

Agora Cloud Recording is an add-on service to record and save voice calls, video calls, and interactive streaming on your cloud storage. Compared with Agora On-premise Recording, Agora Cloud Recording is more efficient and convenient as it does not require deploying Linux servers.

### Compatibility

Agora Cloud Recording is compatible with the following SDKs:

- Agora Native SDK v1.7.0 or later.
- Agora Web SDK v1.12 or later.

## 2022.11.20

This release adds the following improvements:

- Optimizes the Agora Format Converter Script for individual recording, you can refer to [Merge audio and video files](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/develop/merge-files) to get the latest Agora Format Converter Script.

## 2022.10.20

This release supports the postpone transcoding feature globally. You need to set the scene field to `2` (postpone transcoding) when calling the `acquire`. After setting this scene, the recording service transcodes the recorded file within 24 hours after recording to generate an MP4 file, and upload the MP4 file to the third-party cloud storage you specify. Please note that the `region` of the third-party cloud storage must be consistent with the `region` set when calling `acquire`. For details, see [Individual recording](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/develop/individual-mode).

## 2022.8.12
This release adds support for Amazon S3 in some regions. See [Cloud storage configuration](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_start?platform=RESTful#cloud-storage-configuration).

## 2022.5.20

This release adds the following new feature and API changes:

**Mobile web page mode for web page recording**

This release adds mobile web page mode for web page recording. The API changes are as follows:

- Adds the `mobile` field in `extensionServiceConfig`. After setting `mobile` to `true`, the recording service uses the mobile web page mode to record the current web page.
- The value range of the `videoWidth` and `videoHeight` fields in `extensionServiceConfig` is changed to [240, 1920].

**Transcoder script for high availability mechanism**

In composite recording mode, Agora provides a Transcoder script for merging the old M3U8 file with the new M3U8 file generated after the service enables the high availability mechanism into an MP4 file. For details, see [Manage Recorded Files](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_manage_files?platform=RESTful#when-a-server-is-disconnected-or-the-process-killed).

## 2022.1.20
#### New features

**Individual Audio Non-transcoding Recording**

In order to meet the diverse recording needs of users, this release adds the [`streamMode`](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_start?platform=RESTful#recording-configuration) parameter in the `start` method to support [Individual Audio Non-transcoding Recording](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_individual_nontranscoding?platform=RESTful). 

**Postpone Audio Mixing**
For voice chat scenarios, this release adds the [`appsCollection`](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_start?platform=RESTful#application-configuration) and [`transcodeOptions`](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_start?platform=RESTful#transcoding-configuration) parameters in the `start` method to support [Postpone Audio Mixing](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_individual_nontranscoding?platform=RESTful#implement-an-postpone-audio-mixing). If you enable this function, the recording service merges and transcodes the recorded files of all user IDs in the specified channel within 24 hours after the recording ends to generate an MP3/M4A/AAC file, and then uploads the recording file to your specified third-party cloud storage.

**A Combined audio and video file after individual recording**

When calling `start`, set the `streamMode` field of the [`recordingConfig`](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_start?platform=RESTful#recording-configuration) parameter to `standard`, you can get a M3U8 audio index file, a M3U8 video index file and a combined M3U8 audio and video index file. If VP8 encoding is used on the web side, a combined MPD audio and video index file are generated.
You can play the combined audio and video index file directly without using script. Agora recommends that you use this mode.

**Support for the third-party cloud storage service encrypting and labeling recording files**

This release adds the [`extensionParams`](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_api_start?platform=RESTful#cloud-storage-configuration) field to support the third-party cloud storage service to encrypt and tag uploaded recording files.
