## Features

The Agora RDC service boasts the following features:

### One-to-many remote control

Each host side can enable secure access to multiple controlled sides simultaneously. The host side can operate the controlled sides by either using its own mouse and keyboard, or calling API methods. The host side can perform multiple operations, for example, set the environment variables, configure the network connections, install softwares, create files, and debug codes.

### Cross-device drag-and-drop

The Agora RDC service supports file transfer across different devices and platforms. The seamless drag-and-drop feature enables you to drag a file from a host side and drop it on controlled sides.

### Cross-device copy-and-paste

The Agora RDC service supports copying and pasting across different devices and platforms. The seamless copy-and-paste feature enables you to copy texts from a host side and paste them on the notebooks, documents, or code editors of controlled sides.

### Web page recording
