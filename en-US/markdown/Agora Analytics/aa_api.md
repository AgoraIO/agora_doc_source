Agora Analytics provides RESTful APIs for you to retrieve the statistics of your calls and use them in your own application.

Before working with the RESTful APIs, review the Agora Analytics features in [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io) to gain a visual understanding of the quality and usage metrics that are available. See [Agora Analytics](./aa_guide) for details.

You can use the Agora Analytics RESTful APIs to request the following data:

- [Data Insight](#datainsight)
  - Usage statistics within a specified time frame.
  - Quality statistics within a specified time frame.
- [Call Search](#callsearch)
  - A list of calls with basic information.
  - Detailed quality metrics of a call.

<div class="alert info">To use Agora Analytics RESTful APIs, purchase the <a href="https://console.agora.io/support/plan">support package</a > or contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io">support@agora.io</a >.</div>

## Authentication

~747f9590-91b4-11e9-8d5e-b591da73c18d~

## Data format

All requests are sent to the host: `api.agora.io`.

- Request: The request uses query string parameters in the URL.
- Response: The response content is in JSON format.

## <a name="insight"></a>Data Insight

With the Data Insight RESTful APIs, you can query the usage and quality metrics within a specified time frame.

### API limitations

The Data Insight RESTful APIs have the following limitations in terms of request frequency, available data, query time frame, data granularity, and data delay:
