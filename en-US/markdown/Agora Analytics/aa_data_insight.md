## <a name="usage"></a>Usage Overview

The **Usage Overview** page presents **Overall Trend** and **Metric Analysis** for usage metrics, which can help you locate the dates with abnormalities and understand how usage is distributed in different dimensions.

<div class="alert warning">The usage data provided in the Usage Overview page is for reference only and is not used for billing calculation.</div>

### Overall Trend

The **Overall Trend** panel has three sections: **Peak traffic**, **Channel and user count**, and **Service minutes**. In each section, the summary boxes in the upper-left corner highlight the aggregate or peak value of each usage metric, and the line chart in the bottom area shows the daily values of each usage metric. You can click **All data** in the top-right corner of each section to download the data or view it in table form.


The usage metrics are described in [Usage metrics](#usagemetrics).

Each line chart provides the following features:

- Hide and display: To hide or display the line for a usage metric, click on the corresponding summary box.
- Jump to Metric Analysis: To jump to the Metric Analysis panel of a usage metric for a specific day, click the corresponding data point on the line, and select **Metric Analysis**. If you want to use the previously selected time frame, click **Reapply filter** in the upper-left area of the panel.

<div class="alert note">Jump to Metric Analysis is not supported for the following usage metrics: Peak channel traffic, Peak user traffic, and Total number of channels.</div>

### Metric Analysis

The **Metric Analysis** panel has six sections: **Geography**, **Network type**, **Operating system**, **SDK version**, **Device type**, and **Channel size**. Each section presents the top six values for that dimension in bar-chart form.

In the top-right corner of the panel, you can select the usage metric you want to view. In the top-right corner of each section, you can click **All data** to download the data or view it in table form.

The six dimensions are described in [Dimensions](#dimensions).

<div class="alert note"><li>By default, the <b>Geography</b> section presents the region bar chart for the country ranked first in the country bar chart. To see the region bar chart for another country, click the corresponding bubble in the map.</li><li>Items with no usage are not displayed.</li></div>

## <a name="quality"></a>Quality Overview

The **Quality Overview** page presents **Overall Trend** and **Metric Analysis** for quality metrics, which can help you locate the dates and hours with abnormalities and understand how quality is related to usage in different dimensions.

### Overall Trend

The **Overall Trend** panel has two sections: **User experience** and **Success at joining channels**. In each section, the summary boxes in the upper-left corner highlight the peak or bottom value of each quality metric, and the line chart in the bottom area shows the daily or hourly values of each quality metric. You can click **All data** in the top-right corner of the section to download the data or view it in table form.

The quality metrics are described in [Quality metrics](#qualitymetrics).

<div class="alert note">Audio freeze rate is not included in the quality metrics of the Agora RTC SDK for Web. That is, if you select <b>Web RTC</b> for product type in the data filter, the summary box for audio freeze rate does not display in the <b>User experience</b> section.</div>

Each line chart provides the following features:

- Hide and display: To hide or display the line for a quality metric, click on the corresponding summary box.
- Change time selection: When data granularity is set to **Daily** in the data filter, you can click a data point and select **Hourly data**, which changes the data granularity to **Hourly** and the time frame to the hour corresponding to the data point. If you want to switch back to the original filter setting, click **Restore filter** in the upper-center area of the panel.
- Jump to Metric Analysis: To jump to the Metric Analysis panel of a quality metric for a specific day or hour, click the corresponding data point on the line, and select **Metric Analysis**. If you want to use the previously selected time frame, click **Restore** in the upper-left area of the panel.

### Metric Analysis

The **Metric Analysis** panel has six sections: **Geography**, **Network type**, **Operating system**, **SDK version**, **Device type**, and **Channel size**. Each section presents the connection between quality and usage in bubble-chart form.

In the top-right corner of the panel, you can select the quality metric you want to view. In the top-right corner of each section, you can click **All data** to download the data or view it in table form.

## Key terms

This section describes the key terms used in **Data Insight**. See [Agora Key Terms](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms) for more key terms.

### Channel

Every audio or video call happens in a channel. If an app is a building, a channel is a room in the building.

**Data Insight** does not count a channel by name, but by lifecycle. A channel is counted once for each period of time between when the first user joins it until the last user leaves it. That is, it is not counted when there are no users.

### User

Each user in a channel is identified by a unique [user ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#a-nameusernameausername). There can never be two identical user IDs in a channel.

**Data Insight** counts each instance of a unique user ID. If a real-life user joins one channel using multiple user IDs, or joins multiple channels using one user ID, **Data Insight** counts the user in both situations as multiple users.

### Usage metrics

### Calculating usage by the number of users vs. by the number of streams

There are two different approaches to calculating RTC service minutes for a channel: by the number of users in the channel, and by the number of streams each user is subscribed to in the channel. Their difference is described in [How does Agora calculate service minutes](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/faq/billing_basis).
