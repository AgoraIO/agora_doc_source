Media encryption encrypts your appâ€™s audio and video streams with a unique key and salt controlled by the app developer. While not every use case requires media encryption, Agora provides the option to guarantee data confidentiality during transmission. 

This page shows you how to add the media stream encryption to your app.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the encrypted data transmission process after you enable the built-in encryption:

## Prerequisites

Before implementing media stream encryption, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication functions in your project. For details, see [Start a Call](start_call_ios) or [Start Interactive Live Streaming](start_live_ios).

## Implement the built-in encryption

Add the media stream encryption to your app, as follows:

1. To generate a random 32-byte key in the string format through OpenSSL on your server, run the following command:

   ```bash
   // Generate a random 32-byte key in the string format
   openssl rand -hex 32
   dba643c8ba6b6dc738df43d9fd624293b4b12d87a60f518253bd10ba98c48453
   ```

2. To generate a random Base64-encoded, 32-byte salt through OpenSSL on your server, run to the following command:

   ```bash
   // Generate a random 32-byte salt in the Base64 format
   openssl rand -base64 32
   X5w9T+50kzxVOnkJKiY/lUk82/bES2kATOt3vBuGEDw=
   ```

3. The client logic you need to implement is:

   1. Manually add the encryption library to your project, as follows:

      1. Copy `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader.framework` from the SDK package to your project folder.

      2. Open Xcode (take the Xcode 11.0 as an example), go to the **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** menu, click **Add Other...** after clicking **+** to add `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader.framework`. To ensure that the signature of the dynamic library is the same as the signature of the app, you need to set the **Embed** attribute of the dynamic library to **Embed & Sign**.

      3. To import the `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader` library, add the following code to the `ViewController` file:

         ```swift
         import AgoraRtcCryptoLoader
         ```

         <div class="alert warning"><ul><li>According to the requirement of Apple, the <b>Extension</b> of app cannot contain the dynamic library. If you need to integrate the SDK with the dynamic library in the <b>Extension</b>, change the file status as <b>Do Not Embed</b>.</li><li>For more integration methods, see <a href="#othermethods">Other approaches to integrate the encryption library</a></li></ul></div>

   2. Get the key in the string format and the salt in the Base64 format from your server.

   3. Convert the salt from Base64 to uint8_t.

   4. Before joining a channel, call [enableEncryption]() to set the encryption mode and pass the key and salt to the SDK. You can set the encryption mode as `AES_128_GCM2` or `AES_256_GCM2`.
   
      > All users in a channel must use the same encryption mode, key, and salt.
   
      The following sample code shows this logic.
   
      ```swift
      func getEncryptionSaltFromServer() -> Data {
        return "EncryptionKdfSaltInBase64Strings".data(using: .utf8)!
      }
      
      // Creates an EncryptionConfig instance
      let config = AgoraEncryptionConfig()
      // Sets the encryption mode as AES_128_GCM2
      config.encryptionMode = .AES128GCM2
      // Gets the salt in the Base64 format from the server
      config.encryptionKey = getEncryptionKdfSaltBase64FromServer()
      // Gets the key in the string format from your server
      config.encryptionKdfSalt = getEncryptionSaltFromServer()
      let ret = agoraKit.enableEncryption(true, encryptionConfig: config)
      if ret != 0 {
        self.showAlert(title: "Error", message: "enableEncryption call failed: \(ret), please check your params")
      }
      ```
   

## Reference

### Sample project

Agora provides an open-source sample project that implements [built-in encryption](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/blob/dev/3.6.200/iOS/APIExample/Examples/Advanced/StreamEncryption/StreamEncryption.swift) on GitHub. You can try the demo and view the source code.

### Integrate the encryption library through Cocoapods

Integrate the encryption library through Cocoapods, as follows:

1. Install CocoaPods. See the installation guide in  <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started">Getting Started with CocoaPods</a >.

2. In Terminal, go to the project path and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

3. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents and input the following contents. Remember to change `Your App` to the target name of your project, and change `version` to the version of the SDK which you want to integrate.

   ```shell
   # platform :ios, '9.0'
   target 'Your App' do
     pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_iOS_Crypto', '~> version'
   end
   ```

4. Go back to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file in Xcode.

### Considerations

- Both the communication and interactive live streaming scenarios support encryption, but Agora does not support pushing encrypted streams to the CDN during live streaming.
- To use media-stream encryption, you need to enable encryption before joining a channel. Ensure that both the receivers and senders use the same encryption mode, key, and salt; otherwise, undefined behaviors such as a black screen or audio loss occur.
- To enhance security, Agora recommends using a new key and salt every time you enable media-stream encryption.
