Agora Flexible Classroom makes it easy to embed interactive classrooms into iOS apps. It enables you to develop rapidly and easily to enhance your education apps with features including real-time audio and video .

This page shows you the minimum code you need to join a flexible classroom by using the Agora Classroom SDK.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to join a flexible classroom.

When an app client requests to join a flexible classroom, the app client and your app server interact with the Agora server in the following steps:

1. Your app client sends a request to your app server to apply for an RTM token.
2. Your app server generates an RTM token using the Agora [App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID. For details, see [Generate an RTM Token](/en/Real-time-Messaging/token_server_rtm).
3. Your app client calls an API to join a flexible classroom with the following parameters:
   - The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. A string generated by your security system. Must be the same as the user ID that you use for generating an RTM token.
   - The room ID: A string for identifying a classroom. When your app user joins a flexible classroom, Agora automatically creates a classroom with the room ID.
   - The RTM token: A credential for verifying the identity of the user when your app user joins a flexible classroom. 

## Prerequsites

Before proceeding, you must have the following:

- An Agora project with an [Agora App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id) and the aPaaS service configured. See [Configure Flexible Classroom](./agora_class_prep).
- Xcode 10.0 or later.
- CocoaPods 1.10 or later.
- An iOS device (iPhone or iPad) with media input devices, such as a built-in camera and a built-in microphone.
- iOS 10 or later.

## Launch a flexible classroom

This section shows how to launch a flexible classroom using the Agora Classroom SDK.

### 1. Get the iOS project provided by Agora

To clone the iOS project provided by Agora, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-iOS
git fetch
git checkout release/apaas/1.1.0.1-region
```

### 2. Launch a flexible classroom

To launch a flexible classroom, do the following:

1. In `KeyCenter.m`, replace `Your Agora App ID` and `Your Agora App Certificate` with [values from your Agora project](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token).

   > For rapid testing, Agora provides an RTM Token Generator in the CloudClass-iOS project to generate an RTM token with the Agora [App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID.

   ```objective-c
   + (NSString *)appId {
       return <#Your Agora App Id#>;
   }
   
   + (NSString *)appCertificate {
       return <#Your Agora Certificate#>;
   }
   ```

3. Connect your computer to an iOS device, open the sample project on Xcode, and then compile and run the project.

4. After passing in your room name and user name and selecting a classroom type, you join a classroom and see the following page:

## Next steps

Not satisfied with the default UI of Flexible Classroom? Refer to [Customize the UI of Flexible Classroom](./agora_class_custom_ui_ios?platform=iOS) to get the source code of the Agora Classroom SDK, customize the UI with UIKit, and build a Classroom SDK on your own.

You can intergrate the Agora Classroom SDK into your project through CocoaPods, as follows:

1. In Terminal, run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the root directory of your project.

2. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents and input the following contents. Remember to change `Your App` to the target name of your project.

   ```
   # platform :ios, '10.0' use_frameworks!
   target 'Your App' do
      pod 'AgoraClassroomRegionSDK'
   end
   ```

3. Run the `pod install` command to install the SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

4. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
