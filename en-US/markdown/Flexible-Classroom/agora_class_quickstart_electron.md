Agora Flexible Classroom makes it easy to embed interactive classrooms into Windows or macOS apps. It enables you to develop rapidly and easily to enhance your education apps with features including real-time audio and video .

This page shows you the minimum code you need to join a flexible classroom by using the Agora Classroom SDK.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to join a flexible classroom.

When an app client requests to join a flexible classroom, the app client and your app server interact with the Agora server in the following steps:

1. Your app client sends a request to your app server to apply for an RTM token.
2. Your app server generates an RTM token using the Agora [App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID.
3. Your app client calls an API to join a flexible classroom with the following parameters:
   - The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. A string generated by your security system. Must be the same as the user ID that you use for generating an RTM token.
   - The room ID: A string for identifying a classroom. When your app user joins a flexible classroom, Agora automatically creates a classroom with the room ID.
   - The RTM token: A credential for verifying the identity of the user when your app user joins a flexible classroom. In the production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from your app server in your security infrastructure. See [Generate an RTM Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/token_server_rtm).

## Prerequsites

Before proceeding, you must have the following:

- An Agora project with an [Agora App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id) and the aPaaS service configured. See [Configure Flexible Classroom](./agora_class_prep).
- For rapid testing, use the [Temporary RTM Token Generator](https://webdemo.agora.io/token-builder/) to generate a temporary RTM token with the Agora [App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID. The validity period of the token is 24 hours.
- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A Windows or macOS computer with access to the Internet, camera, microphone, and screen recording.

## Launch a flexible classroom 

This section shows how to launch a flexible classroom on macOS or Windows.

### 1. Get the Electron project provided by Agora

To clone the project provided by Agora, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-Desktop.git
git fetch
git checkout release/apaas-1.1.0.1-ga
```

### 2. Configure the project

In `packages/agora-electron-edu-demo/src/renderer/components/app/index.js`, replace `Agora APP ID` and `YOUR RTM TOKEN` with [values that you get](#prerequsites).

> See the detaild description of parameters in the [launch](./agora_class_api_ref_web?platform=Electron#launch) method.

```js
AgoraEduSDK.config({
    // Here pass in the Agora App ID you have got
    appId: "<Agora APP ID>",
    })
    AgoraEduSDK.launch(
    document.querySelector(`#${this.elem.id}`), {
        // Here pass in the RTM token you have generated
        rtmToken: "<YOUR RTM TOKEN>",
        // The user ID must be the same as the one you used for generating the RTM token
        userUuid: "test",
        userName: "teacher",
        roomUuid: "4321",
        roleType: 1,
        roomType: 0,
        roomName: "demo-class",
        pretest: false,
        language: "en",
        startTime: new Date().getTime(),
        duration: 60 * 30,
        courseWareList: [],
        listener: (evt) => {
        console.log("evt", evt)
        }
}
)
```

### 3. Launch a flexible classroom

**macOS**

Launch a flexible classroom on macOS, as follows:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the CloudClass-Desktop project and run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```shell
   # Install global dev dependencies
   yarn
   # Install all dependencies via lerna and yarn
   yarn bootstrap
   ```

2. Navigate to the `packages/agora-electron-edu-demo` directory of the CloudClass-Desktop project and run the following command to build the app:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

   You see the following page:

**Windows**

Launch a flexible classroom on Windows, as follows:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the CloudClass-Desktop project and run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```shell
   # Install global dev dependencies
   yarn
   # Install all dependencies via lerna and yarn
   yarn bootstrap
   ```

2. Replace the `"agora_electron"` object in `packages/agora-electron-edu-demo/package.json` with the following object:

   ```json
   "agora_electron": {
     "electron_version": "7.1.2",
     "prebuilt": true,
     "platform": "win32",
     "arch": "ia32"
   },
   ```

3. Run the following command to install electron 7.1.14:

   ```
   npm install electron@7.1.14 --arch=ia32 --save-dev
   ```

4. Navigate to the `packages/agora-electron-edu-demo` directory of the CloudClass-Desktop project and run the following command to build the app:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
