Agora Flexible Classroom makes it easy to embed interactive classrooms into Android apps. It enables you to develop rapidly and easily to enhance your education apps with features including real-time audio and video .

This page shows you the minimum code you need to join a flexible classroom by using the Agora Classroom SDK.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to join a flexible classroom.

When an app client requests to join a flexible classroom, the app client and your app server interact with the Agora server in the following steps:

1. Your app client sends a request to your app server to apply for an RTM token.
2. Your app server generates an RTM token using the Agora [App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID.
3. Your app client calls an API to join a flexible classroom with the following parameters:
   - The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. A string generated by your security system. Must be the same as the user ID that you use for generating an RTM token.
   - The room ID: A string for identifying a classroom. When your app user joins a flexible classroom, Agora automatically creates a classroom with the room ID.
   - The RTM token: A credential for verifying the identity of the user when your app user joins a flexible classroom. In the production environment, your app client retrieves tokens from your app server in your security infrastructure. See [Generate an RTM Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/token_server_rtm).

## Prerequsites

Before proceeding, you must have the following:

- An Agora project with an [Agora App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id) and the aPaaS service configured. See [Configure Flexible Classroom](./agora_class_prep).
- [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Android Studio 2.0 or later.
- Android 4.4 or later.
- An Android device.

## Launch a flexible classroom

This section shows how to launch a flexible classroom using the Agora Classroom SDK.

### 1. Get the Android project provided by Agora

To clone the Android project provided by Agora, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-Android.git
```

### 2. Launch a flexible classroom

To launch a flexible classroom, do the following:

1. Open the CloudClass-Android project in Android Studio.

2. In `app/src/normal/res/values/string_config.xml`, replace `Agora App ID` and `Agora App Certificate` with [values from your Agora project](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token).

   > For rapid testing, Agora provides an RTM Token Generator in the CloudClass-Android project to generate an RTM token with the Agora [App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID.

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <resources>
           <string name="agora_app_id" translatable="false">Agora App ID</string>
           <string name="agora_app_cert" translatable="false">Agora App Certificate</string>
           <string name="agora_api_host" translatable="false">Agora API Host</string>
           <string name="agora_report_host" translatable="false">Report API Host</string>
   </resources>
   ```

3. Build the project in Android Studio, and run it on a simulator or a physical mobile device. You can see the following page:
