To use Agora Flexible Classroom, you need to enable and configure the aPaaS service in Agora Console.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring the aPaaS service, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- A valid Agora account with an active Agora project. See [Create an Agora Project](/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token#create-an-agora-project).
- Enable the Agora Interactive Whiteboard service and get the App Identifier and SDK Token of the Agora Interactive Whiteboard service. See [Enable and Configure Interactive Whiteboard Service](/en/whiteboard/enable_whiteboard).
- Third-party cloud storage for storing class files and recorded files in Flexible Classroom. Agora supports only [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls) now.
- [Generate a set of Customer ID and secret](/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token#generate-a-set-of-customer-id-and-secret) for Agora RESTful API access.

## Configure the aPaaS service

Configure the aPaaS service in Agora Console, as follows:

1. Log in to Agora Console and enter the [project management](https://console.agora.io/projects) page. In your Agora project, click **edit**. In **Edit**, click the **Configure aPaaS** button.

   ![apaas-configuration](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1618474816680)

2. On the **aPaaS Configuration** page, select the tickbox next to **Whiteboard** and **Cloud recording** to enable these two functions.

   For example:

   - Interactive Whiteboard

     ```json
     {
             "appId": "<your_whiteboard_app_id>",
             "token": "<your_whiteboard_sdk_token>",
             "oss": {
                 "vendor": 1,
                 "region": "",
                 "endpoint": "",
                 "bucket": "",
                 "folder": "",
                 "accessKey": "",
                 "secretKey": ""
             }  
         }
```

   - Cloud Recording

     ```json
     {
             "recordingConfig": {},
             "storageConfig": {
                 "vendor": 1,
                 "region": 1,
                 "bucket": "<your_bucket_name>",
                 "accessKey": "<your_access_key>",
                 "secretKey": "<your_secret_key>",
                 "fileNamePrefix": ["directory1","directory2"],
                 "endpoint": ""
               }
     }
```
