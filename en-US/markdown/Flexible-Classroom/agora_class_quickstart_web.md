Agora Flexible Classroom makes it easy to embed interactive classrooms into Web apps. It enables you to develop rapidly and easily to enhance your education apps with features including real-time audio and video interaction, real-time messaging, interactive whiteboard, and other teaching tools.

This page shows you the minimum code you need to join a flexible classroom in your Web app by using the  Agora Classroom SDK.

## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow to join a flexible classroom.

When an app client requests to join a flexible classroom, the app client and your app server interact with the Agora server in the following steps:

1. Your app client sends a request to your app server to apply for an RTM token.
2. Your app server generates an RTM token using the Agora [App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID. For details, see [Generate an RTM Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Real-time-Messaging/token_server_rtm).
3. Your app client calls an API to join a flexible classroom with the following parameters:
   - The user ID: The unique identifier of a user. A string generated by your security system. Must be the same as the user ID that you use for generating an RTM token.
   - The room ID: A string for identifying a classroom. When your app user joins a flexible classroom, Agora automatically creates a classroom with the room ID.
   - The RTM token: A credential for verifying the identity of the user when your app user joins a flexible classroom. 

## Prerequsites

Before proceeding, you must have the following:

- An Agora project with an [Agora App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id) and the aPaaS service configured. See [Configure Flexible Classroom](./agora_class_prep).
- For rapid testing, use the [Temporary RTM Token Generator](https://webdemo.agora.io/token-builder/) to generate a temporary RTM token with the Agora [App ID](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-id), [App Certificate](./Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-the-app-certificate), and a user ID. The validity period of the token is 24 hours.
- The latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.cn/chrome/) on desktop.
- Physical media input devices, such as a built-in camera and a built-in microphone.

## Launch a flexible classroom

This section shows how to integrate the Agora Classroom SDK into your application and call the methods provided by the SDK to launch a flexible classroom.

### 1. Create a basic Web project

Follow the steps to create a minimal Web project:

1. Create a new directory named `agora_flexible_classroom`.
2. In `agora_flexible_classroom`, create a `index.html` file, which contains both the visual user interface and the programmable interface that uses the Agora Classroom SDK to implement the app logic.

### 2. Implement the app logic

To implement the app logic,copy the following code into `index.html`, then replace `appID` and `rtmToken` with [values that you get](#prerequsites).

In the following code snippet, we do the following things:

1. Integrate the Agora Classroom SDK into your project through the CDN.

2. Call the `AgoraEduSDK.config` method to configure the SDK globally. For the detailed description of parameters, see the API reference of [ `AgoraEduSDK.config`](./agora_class_api_ref_web?platform=Web#config).

3. Call the `AgoraEduSDK.launch` method to launch the classroom. For the detailed description of parameters, see the API reference of [`AgoraEduSDK.launch`](./agora_class_api_ref_web?platform=Web#launch).
