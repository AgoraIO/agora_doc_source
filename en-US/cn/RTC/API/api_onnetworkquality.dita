   <p>Last mile refers to the connection between the local device and Agora&apos;s edge server.</p>
   <p>This callback reports once every two seconds the last mile network conditions of each user in the channel. If a channel includes multiple users, the SDK triggers this callback as many times.</p>

  <pd>Uplink network quality rating of the user in terms of the transmission bitrate, packet loss rate, average RTT (Round-Trip Time) and jitter of the uplink network. @p txQuality is a quality rating helping you understand how well the current uplink network conditions can support the selected VideoEncoderConfiguration. For example, a 1000 Kbps uplink network may be adequate for video frames with a resolution of 640 480 and a frame rate of 15 fps in the `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile, but may be inadequate for resolutions higher than 1280 720. See <xref keyref="QUALITY_TYPE"/>.</pd>

  <pd>Downlink network quality rating of the user in terms of packet loss rate, average RTT, and jitter of the downlink network. See <xref keyref="QUALITY_TYPE"/>.</pd>
