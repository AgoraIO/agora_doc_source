   <p>This method initializes the video view of a remote stream on the local device. It affects only the video view that the local user sees. Call this method to bind the remote video stream to a video view and to set the rendering and mirror modes of the video view.</p>
   <p>The application specifies the uid of the remote video in this method before the remote user joins the channel. If you cannot get the ID of the remote user before joining the channel, you can<xref keyref="onUserJoined"/> call this method when the callback is received.</p>
            <p>To unbind the remote user from the view, set<xref keyref="VideoCanvas"/> the view in VideoCanvas<parmname></parmname> to NULL.</p>
            <p>Once the remote user leaves the channel, the SDK unbinds the remote user.</p>
   <note outputclass="note">
       <ul>
           <li>If you want to update the rendering or mirroring mode of the remote user&apos;s view during a call, please use the<xref keyref="setRemoteRenderMode2"/> method.</li>
           <li>If you use the Agora recording service, the recording service will join the channel as a dumb client, so the callback will also be triggered<xref keyref="onUserJoined"/>. Since the recording service does not send a video stream, the app does not need to bind a view to it. If the app cannot recognize the dumb client, it can<xref keyref="onFirstRemoteVideoDecoded"/> bind the remote user view when it receives the callback.</li>
