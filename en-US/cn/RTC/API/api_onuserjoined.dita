   <li>`COMMUNICATION` profile: This callback notifies the application that another user joins the channel. If other users are already in the channel, the SDK also reports to the application on the existing users.</li>
   <li>In a live-broadcast channel, this callback indicates that a host joins the channel. If other hosts are already in the channel, the SDK also reports to the application on the existing hosts. Agora recommends limiting the number of hosts to 17.</li>
        </ul>
  <p>The SDK triggers this callback under one of the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Occurs when a remote user or host<apiname keyref="joinChannel1"/> joins the channel.</li>
   <li>Called after the remote user joins the channel<apiname keyref="setClientRole1"/> to change the user role as the host.</li>
   <li>A remote user/host rejoins the channel after a network interruption.</li>
   <li>The host<apiname keyref="addInjectStreamUrl"/> successfully entered the online media stream by calling the method.</li>
        </ul>

     <p>`LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile:</p>
     <ul>
    <li>The host receives this callback when another host joins the channel.</li>
    <li>The audience in the channel receives this callback when a new host joins the channel.</li>
    <li>When a web application joins the channel, the SDK triggers this callback as long as the web application publishes streams.</li>
