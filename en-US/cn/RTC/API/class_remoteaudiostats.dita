               <p>During the statistical period, the Agora real-time audio MOS (average subjective opinion score) evaluation method scores the quality of the received remote audio stream. The return value range is [0,500]. The return value is divided by 100 to get the MOS score, in the range of [0,5] points. The higher the score, the better the audio quality.</p>
