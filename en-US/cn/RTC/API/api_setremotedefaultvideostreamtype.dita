In the case of limited network conditions, if the sender does not call<xref keyref="enableDualStreamMode"/> (<ph keyref="false"/>) to close the dual stream mode, the receiver can choose to receive a large stream or a small stream. Dual streams are a hybrid of a high-quality video stream and a low-quality video stream: - High-quality video stream: High bitrate, high resolution. - Low-quality video stream: Low bitrate, low resolution. Dual streams are a hybrid of a high-quality video stream and a low-quality video stream: - High-quality video stream: High bitrate, high resolution. - Low-quality video stream: Low bitrate, low resolution.</p>

Call this method if you want to switch to the low-video stream. This method allows the app to adjust the corresponding video stream type based on the size of the video window to reduce the bandwidth and resources. This method allows the app to adjust the corresponding video stream type based on the size of the video window to reduce the bandwidth and resources. The aspect ratio of the low-video stream is the same as the high-quality video stream. The aspect ratio of the low-video stream is the same as the high-quality video stream. Once the resolution of the high-quality video stream is set, the system automatically sets the resolution, frame rate, and bitrate of the low-video stream. Once the resolution of the high-quality video stream is set, the system automatically sets the resolution, frame rate, and bitrate of the low-video stream.</p>
