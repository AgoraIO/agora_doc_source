## Overview

ExtApp is a tool for embedding plug-ins in Flexible Classroom. Plug-ins implemented by ExtApp can be regarded as an independent application with its own life cycle and data management, but they also depend on the Agora Classroom SDK. You can customize the user interfaces of the plug-in, pass custom data to the Agora Classroom SDK, and monitor data changes through ExtApp. ExtApp enables you to embed custom plug-ins, such as a countdown tool or a dice in the  Flexible Classroom.

The source code of ExtApp is located in the [AgoraExtApp` directory in `the CloudClass-iOS](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/CloudClass-iOS) repository on GitHub.

This page describes the procedure of using ExtApp to embed a custom plug-in in the Flexible Classroom.

## Procedure

### 1. Implement a plug-in

First, you need to inherit the `AgoraBaseExtApp` class and implement a custom plug-in in your App.

The methods and callbacks in the` AgoraExtAppBase` class are introduced as follows:

#### Method

**initWithAppIdentifier**

```swift
(instancetype)initWithAppIdentifier:(NSString *)appIdentifier
                      localUserInfo: (AgoraExtAppUserInfo *) userInfo
                           roomInfo:(AgoraExtAppRoomInfo *)roomInfo
                         properties:(NSDictionary *)properties;
```

Initialize the plugin.

**updateProperties**

```swift
(void)updateProperties:(NSDictionary *)properties
               success:(AgoraExtAppCompletion)success
                  fail:(AgoraExtAppErrorCompletion)fail;
```

Update attributes. Other plug-ins will` receive updated property information through propertiesDidUpdate`.

**deleteProperties**

```swift
(void)deleteProperties:(NSArray <NSString *> *)keys
               success:(AgoraExtAppCompletion)success
                  fail:(AgoraExtAppErrorCompletion)fail;
```

Delete attributes. Other plug-ins will` receive the deleted property information through propertiesDidUpdate`.

**unload**

```swift
(void)unload;
```

Remove the plug-in. After successfully calling this method, the `onExtAppUnloaded `callback will be triggered.

#### Callback

**propertiesDidUpdate**

```swift
(void)propertiesDidUpdate:(NSDictionary *)properties;
```

The attributes have been updated.

**extAppDidLoad**

```swift
(void)extAppDidLoad:(AgoraExtAppContext *)context;
```

The plugin has been loaded. You can initialize in this callback.

**extAppWillUnload**

```swift
(void)extAppWillUnload;
```

The plugin will be uninstalled. You can perform operations such as data backup in this callback.

### 2. Register the plug-in

Call the `Agora method to register the plug-in` in the Agora Classroom SDK.

The following sample code demonstrates how to register a countdown plug-in CountDownExtApp.

```swift
// appIdentifier: The plug-in ID, which will be used to identify the plug-in. The same plug-in on different platforms must use the same ID. 
// extAppClass: Container App Class Type, an instance of this class is created by the SDK. 
// frame: the size of the plug-in container, representing the distance from the bottom view. The bottom view is generated by the Classroom SDK (not including the security zone). 
// language: container language, Classroom SDK will pass this variable to the specific plug-in container, so that the container can set multiple languages by itself. 
let countDown = AgoraExtAppConfiguration (appIdentifier: "io.agora.countdown",
                                         extAppClass: CountDownExtApp.self,
                                         frame: UIEdgeInsets(top: 10,
                                                            left: 50,
                                                          bottom: 10,
                                                           right: 50),
                                                        language: "en",


// The plug-in icon is used to set on the UIKit layer, and will be displayed in the toolbox pop-up window of the whiteboard toolbar by default. 
countDown.image = image
countDown.selectedImage = selectedImage
let apps = [countDown]
AgoraEduSDK.registerExtApps(apps)
```

### 3. Use the plug-in

By default, the registered plug-in is displayed in the whiteboard toolbar in the Flexible Classroom.

If you want to customize an entry for the plug-in, you can modify the corresponding file of the UI Kit module, add an entry for the plug-in in the three major scenes of  Flexible Classroom, and then call the following method when the plug-in is clicked or displayed.

```java
// Pass in the plug-in ID in the willLaunchExtApp method. 
extAppContext?.willLaunchExtApp(appIdentifier)
```
