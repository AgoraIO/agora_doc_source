    <shortdesc id="short"><ph id="shortdesc"> The SDK uses the <apiname
                keyref="IRtcEngineEventHandler"/> interface to send event notifications to your app.
            Your app can get those notifications through methods that inherit this
        interface.</ph></shortdesc>

            <p>All methods in this interface have default (empty) implementation. You can choose to
                inherit events related to your app scenario. In the callbacks, avoid implementing
                time-consuming tasks or calling APIs that may cause thread blocking (such as
                sendMessage). Otherwise, the SDK may not work properly.</p>
