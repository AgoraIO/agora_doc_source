All methods in this class provide default (empty) implementations, and you can selectively inherit methods as needed.

            <p props="android"><xref keyref="IRtcEngineEventHandler"/> is an interface class used by the SDK to send event callbacks to the application layer. You can inherit this class to receive the desired event notifications. All methods in this interface are empty by default, and you can override them selectively as needed. To ensure proper SDK operation, avoid performing time-consuming operations or calling blocking APIs such as <codeph>SendMessage</codeph> in the callback methods.</p>
