Since a multi-hosted interactive streaming scenario has multiple users, Agora recommends downloading and installing the demo app on **two** mobile devices. After installation, follow these steps to test the demo app:

1. On one device, click **Agora Live** and choose **Multi Hosts**.
2. Click the **Camera** icon on the lower right and enter a room name to create a channel. The user who first joins the channel becomes the host.
3. On the other device, click **Agora Live**, choose **Multi Hosts**, and join the created channel as an audience member.
4. On the host side, tap the user profile to invite an audience member for co-hosting; on the audience side, tap a vacant host seat to apply for co-hosting.
5. During co-hosting, the host can tap a host seat to stop co-hosting, mute and unmute a co-host, and close a host seat.
