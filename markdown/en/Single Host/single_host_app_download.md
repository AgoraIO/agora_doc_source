Since a Single Host scenario has a host and audience members, Agora recommends downloading and installing the demo app on **two** mobile devices. After installation, follow these steps to test the demo app:

1. Click **Agora Live** and choose **Single Host**.
2. On one device, click the **Camera** icon on the lower right and enter a room name to create a channel. Join the channel as the host.
3. On the other device, join the created channel as an audience member.
