Since a PK Host scenario has two hosts across two channels, Agora recommends downloading and installing the demo app on **two** mobile devices. After installation, follow these steps to test the demo app:

1. Click **Agora Live** and choose **PK Host**.
2. Click the **Camera** icon on the lower right, and enter a room name to create a channel. Repeat this step on the other device to create a second channel. Ensure that you use different names for the channels.
3. On one device, join a channel and click the **PK** icon on the lower right. From the room listing, choose the name of the other channel, and click **Invite**.
4. On the other device, join the corresponding channel and click **Accept**. When the co-hosting begins, you should be able to see the video of both channels on both devices.
