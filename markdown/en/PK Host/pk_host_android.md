## Core API call sequence

The following diagrams show the core APIs that the Agora Live Demo app uses to implement a PK Host scenario. Refer to them to implement the various functions in your project.

<div class="alert note">The Cloud Service in the demo app is implemented by Agora, and you need to deploy your own cloud service for the same purposes.</div>

- The host joins the room and sends a PK host invitation.

## Additional functions

**Image enhancement**

The Agora Live Demo app uses a third-party SDK for image enhancement. You can refer to the source code in the faceunity file to implement the function.

**Network quality detection**

Use the `onRtcStats` callback to detect and report the network quality in real-time. Triggered once every two seconds during a live broadcast, this callback reports statistics, including the sending and receiving bitrate and packet loss rate.

**Mute the local audio and video**

Call `muteLocalAudioStream` or `muteLocalVideoStream` to stop sending local audio or video streams.

**In-ear monitoring**

Call `enableInEarMonitoring` to enable the in-ear monitor function on the host's client.

**Audio mixing**

After joining the channel, call `startAudioMixing` on the host's client to play background music.

## Open-source sample project

Agora provides an open-source sample project for [PK Host](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Usecase/AgoraLive) on GitHub for you to download as a source code reference.
