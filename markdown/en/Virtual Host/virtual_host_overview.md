## Introduction

In a virtual host scenario, a host uses an avatar for live streaming. The avatar can imitate the expressions and the actions of the host in real time. During live streaming, the host can invite an audience member to become a co-host or stop co-hosting. 

## Feature list

You can use the Agora SDKs to implement the following features in your project:

| Feature | Description |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Animoji	      | The host uses an avatar for live streaming. The avatar can imitate the expressions and the actions of the host in real time. |
| Interactive <br>co-hosting       | The host invites the audience members or the audience members apply to become a co-host. All audience members in the channel can see and hear the host and co-hosts interacting with each other in real time. |
| Inviting an audience member to become a co-host or stop the co-hosting        | An audience member who takes up a host seat can interact with the host. The host has the following control privileges over the co-hosts and host seats: <ul><li>Invite a co-host: The host invites an audience member to become a co-host, who then can interact with the host.</li> <li>Stop co-hosting: The host switches a co-host back to an audience member.</li></ul> |
| Real-time messaging	| The host, co-hosts, and the audience can chat with each other through text messages.|
| Room status management		| All users in the room can see the room type, the number, and the list of online users. |
| Real-time quality statistics	| Before joining a channel or during interactive streaming, all users can check the network quality in real time. |
| Background music |  For better interaction effects, the host and co-hosts can play background music when talking or singing. |

## Try the demo app

Agora provides the Virtual Host demo apps on the following platforms:

| Android | iOS | 
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| [App Downloads](./downloads?platform=Android)   |[App Downloads](./downloads?platform=iOS)     | 

Since a virtual host interactive streaming scenario has multiple users, Agora recommends downloading and installing the demo app on **two** mobile devices. After installation, follow these steps to test the demo app:

1. On one device, click **Agora Live** and choose **Virtual Host**.
2. Click the **Camera** icon on the lower right and enter a room name to create a channel. The user must choose an avatar. The user who first joins the channel becomes the host.
3. On the other device, click **Agora Live**, choose **Virtual Host**, and join the created channel as an audience member.
4. On the host side, click the user profile to invite an audience member for co-hosting.
5. After receiving the co-host invitation, the audience member chooses an avatar.
6. During co-hosting, the host can click **Leave** to stop co-hosting. The co-host can also click **Leave** to stop co-hosting.

## Technical solutions

Agora recommends using the following SDKs or services to implement a multi-hosted interactive streaming scenario:

| Product | Function |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Agora RTC SDK      | Joins an RTC channel for real-time audio and video communication.      |
| Agora RTM SDK | Logs into the RTM system and joins an RTM channel for sending and receiving text messages. |
| Cloud Service | Manages host seats, room information, and user information.  |
| Third-party Animoji SDK   | The avatar can imitate the expressions and the actions of the host in real time.  |

<div class="alert note">The Cloud Service in the demo app is implemented by Agora, and you need to deploy your own cloud service for the same purposes.</div>

## Advantages

**Ultra low latency** 

Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ is the Agora proprietary network for audio and video transmission, covering more than 200 countries and regions. It uses the intelligent routing algorithms to ensure that the average end-to-end latency worldwide is less than 400 ms.

**Stability and reliability**

The Agora SLA (Service Level Agreement) ensures a 99%+ login success rate and 99.99% service accessibility throughout the year.

**Excellent performance under poor network conditions**

With an industry-leading algorithm designed to minimize the impact of packet loss, Agora guarantees smooth audio and video communication when the packet loss rate reaches 70%, and smooth audio communication when the packet loss rate is as high as 80%.

When a user's network bandwidth is poor, our self-adaptive strategy prioritizes the communication of the audio and the host.

**High audio quality**

The following technologies ensure that the speaker's voice always stands out from a noisy environment:

- A maximum audio sampling rate of 48 kHz for full band frequency.
- The 3A algorithm featuring automatic echo cancellation (AEC), automatic noise suppression (ANS), and automatic gain control (AGC).

**Voice changer**

During interactive live streaming, adding voice changer and reverberation effects brings much fun and enhances the atmosphere of the live room. Agora provides an enriched selection of voice changer options, which developers can easily implement by calling an API.

**High-definition video**

Agora optimizes the video experience from the following perspectives:

- Supports a maximum resolution of 4K to accommodate the growing demand for high-definition video.
- Works with most main-stream devices, platforms, and scenarios by supporting H.265 codec, super resolution, and perceptual video coding.
- Uses a dynamic bitrate algorithm to adapt the video bitrate to the real-time network conditions for resolutions from 48p to 1080p.
- For a set resolution and frame rate, consumes less bandwidth and renders higher quality video.

**Support for third-party services**

For more enriched and diversified scenarios, you can easily import third-party services into your project, such as content moderation, image enhancement, and AR.

**Traceability**

- Agora provides a variety of methods for measuring network quality. We also have callbacks that report on communication quality during interactive live streaming. Use these methods to ensure a smooth experience and to troubleshoot quality issues.
- You can also use [Agora Analytics](https://console.agora.io/analytics/call/search) to monitor the quality, user behavior, device state, and Quality of Experience (QoE)/Quality of Service (QoS) statistics.

**Compatibility**

Agora SDKs are compatible with more than 6,000 devices, covering over 18 platforms and development architectures, including Windows, macOS, Web, iOS, Android, and Electron. This ensures that all users share the same experience.
