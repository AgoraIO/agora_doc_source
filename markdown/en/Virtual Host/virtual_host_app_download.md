Since a virtual host interactive streaming scenario has multiple users, Agora recommends downloading and installing the demo app on **two** mobile devices. After installation, follow these steps to test the demo app:

1. On one device, click **Agora Live** and choose **Virtual Host**.
2. Click the **Camera** icon on the lower right and enter a room name to create a channel. The user must choose an avatar. The user who first joins the channel becomes the host.
3. On the other device, click **Agora Live**, choose **Virtual Host**, and join the created channel as an audience member.
4. On the host side, click the user profile to invite an audience member for co-hosting.
5. After receiving the co-host invitation, the audience member chooses an avatar.
6. During co-hosting, the host can click **Leave** to stop co-hosting. The co-host can also click **Leave** to stop co-hosting.
