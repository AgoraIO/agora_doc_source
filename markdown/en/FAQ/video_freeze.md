Choppy video may be caused by a slow network connection or sub-optimal device performance. Complete the following steps to troubleshoot choppy video.

## Step 1: Self-check

Check the following:

* Check whether the choppy video is intermittent or consistent. Occasional, intermittent choppy video is normal due to the nature of the network and device.
* Check whether the network connection is stable. If it is stable but the video is still choppy, change your network connection and re-check.
* Switch to another device with better performance.
* Turn off all pre-processing options, such as image enhancement, to determine whether it is the cause of the choppy video.

## Step 2: Contact Agora customer support

If the issue persists, contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) and report the issue with the following information:
* The channel name and the UIDs of the users sending and receiving the video.
* The time frame during which the choppy video playback appears.
* SDK log files. See [How can I set the log file?](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/logfile)
* Screen recording files.
