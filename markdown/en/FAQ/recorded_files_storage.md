If you use the Agora On-premise Recording service, the recorded files will be stored on your Linux server. For more information, see [Manage the Recording Files](/en/Recording/recording_manage_files?platform=Linux). 

If you use the Agora Cloud Recording service, Agora will automatically split the recorded contents into multiple TS files and upload them to the third-party cloud storage that you provide (Amazon S3 or Alibaba). For more information, see [Manage Recorded Files](/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_manage_files).
