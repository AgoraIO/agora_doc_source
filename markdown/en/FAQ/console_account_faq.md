This page provides solutions to issues that users may encounter when using Agora Console.

## Why can't I use my email address to login to Agora Console after successfully signing up with a third-party account? 

**Issue description**

You can log in to Agora Console with a registered email address or third-party account, such as Google, GitHub, or WeChat. During this process, you may encounter the following issues:

- Have signed up to Agora Console with a third-party account, but cannot use the e-mail address and password of the third-party account to login to Agora Console.
- Have signed up to Agora Console with an email address but cannot bind the Agora account to a third-party account.

**Reason**

The email signup and login is independent of the third-party signup and login within Agora Console. You can only use the credentials that you used to sign up to Agora Console for your logins.

**Solution**

- If you have signed up to Agora Console with a third-party account, use the third-party account for your logins.
- If you have signed up to Agora Console with your email address, use this along with your password for your logins or provide a phone number for code verification. You cannot bind your Agora account to a third-party account, even if it shares the same email address.

## Why can't I submit an ID Authentication at Agora Console?

**Issue description**

You cannot submit an ID Authentication at Agora Console after verifying your phone number.

**Reason**

**ID Authentication** is required only for the following users:

- A user who has passed phone number verification and whose number is from mainland China.
- A user who has completed email verification and whose IP address is from mainland China.

Users that do not fall into the above two categories can use the Agora services directly without the need for an ID authentication.

**Solution**

You do not need ID authentication if your phone number or IP address is not from mainland China. If you need ID authenticationn for getting an invoice,  ensure that your phone number or IP address is from mainland China.
