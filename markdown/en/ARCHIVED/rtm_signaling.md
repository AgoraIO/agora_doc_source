The Agora Real-time Messaging SDK (RTM) is designed to replace the legacy Signaling SDK with much more exciting features, such as higher concurrency, higher reliability, lower latency, and better compatibility. 

Our plan: 

- Interoperability between the Agora RTM SDK and the Agora Signaling SDK is not yet implemented but will be implemented soon.
- Maintenance to the legacy Signaling SDK will end in the fourth quarter of 2019.
