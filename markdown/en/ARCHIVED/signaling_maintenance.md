We are phasing out Agora Signaling SDK in the next year, going forward we will continue to add more great features to the Agora RTM SDK. Please see below our sunset plan for the Agora Signaling SDK: 

- As of August 1st, 2019, the Agora Signaling system has entered sunset phase. We will not add new features but will fix any reported critical bugs.  By August 12th, 2019, all related documents will be moved [here](https://docs.agora.io/cn/Real-time-Messaging/signaling_sunset?platform=All%20Platforms).
- By December 31st 2019, we will stop updating the legacy Agora Signaling system, but will maintain the system in operation mode. 
- On June 30th, 2020, we will officially sunset our legacy Signaling service and shut down the legacy Signaling servers.
