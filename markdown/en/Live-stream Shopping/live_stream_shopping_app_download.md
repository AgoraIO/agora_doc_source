Since a live-stream shopping scenario has multiple users, Agora recommends downloading and installing the demo app on **two** mobile devices. After installation, follow these steps to test the demo app:

1. On one device, click **Agora Live**, and choose **Live Stream Shopping**.
2. Click the **Camera** icon on the lower right, and then enter a room name to create a channel. Click **Start** to start the live interactive streaming as a host.
3. On the other device, click **Agora Live**, choose **Live Stream Shopping**, and join the created channel to watch the interactive streaming as an audience member.
4. On the host side, tap the ![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1602226164257) icon at the bottom of the screen to expand the product list. Choose the products in the **Pending** column and click **Launch** to put the chosen products on sale.
5. On the audience side, click the product list to see the products for sale. Select the product that you want to buy and click its link to place an order. 
6. During live-stream shopping, the host can click the **PK** icon to invite the host of another channel to begin co-hosting; an audience member can become a co-host to interact with the host in real-time.
