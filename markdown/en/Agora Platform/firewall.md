This page describes the firewall requirements for all Agora SDKs. Before accessing Agoraâ€™s services, ensure that you open the ports and whitelist the domains specified in this article.

## Agora Native SDK

-   Open TCP ports: 1080, 8000, 9700, 25000, and 30000.
-   Open UDP ports: 1080, 4000 to 4030, 7000, 8000, 8913, 9700, and 25000.
-   Whitelist domains: `.agora.io`, `vocs1.agora.io`, `vocs2.agora.io`, `vocs3.agora.io`, `vocs4.agora.io`, `vocs5.agora.io`, `qoslbs.agoralab.co`, `qos.agoralab.co` , `ap1.agora.io`, `ap2.agora.io`, `ap3.agora.io`, `ap4.agora.io`, and `ap5.agora.io`.


## Agora Web SDK

-   Open TCP ports: 80, 443, 3433, 5668, 5669, 5866 to 5890, 6080, 6443, 8667, and 9667.
-   Open UDP ports: 3478 and 10000 to 65535.
-   Whitelist domain: `.agora.io`.


## Agora Signaling SDK

-   Open TCP ports: 1080 and 8001 to 8199.
-   Open UDP ports: 8180 to 8199.
-   Whitelist domain: `.agora.io`, `vocs.agora.io`, `qoslbs.agora.io`, and `qos.agora.io`.


## Agora Recording SDK

-   Open TCP ports: 1080 and 8000.
-   Open UDP ports:
    -   Duplex ports: 1080, 4000 to 4030, 8000, 9700 and 25000;
    -   Simplex downstream ports used by recording processes.
-   Whitelist domains: `.agora.io`, `vocs.agora.io`, `qoslbs.agoralab.io`, and `qos.agoralab.io`.

> To record the content in channels, you need one recording process for each of the channels. One recording thread requires four simplex downstream ports. There must be no port conflict among processes, including system processes and all recording processes.
> 
> -   Agora recommends that you specify the range of ports used by the recording processes. Configure a large range for all recording processes \(Agora recommends 40000 to 41000 or larger\). If so, the Recording SDK assigns ports to each recording process within the specified range and avoids port conflicts automatically. To set the port range, you need to configure the lowUdpPort and highUdpPort parameters.
> 
> -   If the lowUdpPort and highUdpPort parameters are not specified, the ports used by the recording processes are at random, which may cause port conflicts.


## Agora Gaming SDK

-   Open TCP ports: 1080 and 8000.
-   Open UDP ports: 1080, 4000 to 4030, 8000, 9700 and 25000.
-   Whitelist domains: `.agora.io`, `vocs.agora.io`, `qoslbs.agora.io`, and `qos.agora.io`.

You must use UDP ports rather than TCP ports for superior voice and video quality since UDP prioritizes timeliness over reliability.
