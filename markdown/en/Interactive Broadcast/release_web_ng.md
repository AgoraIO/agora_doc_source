## Overview

The Agora Web SDK 4.x is a JavaScript and TypeScript library loaded by an HTML web page. The SDK library uses APIs in the web browser to establish connections and control the communication and interactive live streaming services. 

**Compatibility**

For the web browser support of the Agora Web SDK, see [Which browsers does the Agora Web SDK support?](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/browser_support)

<div class="alert note">To ensure better end user experience, Agora highly recommends using the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">latest version</a> of Google Chrome on desktop.</div>

## v4.1.0

Agora Web SDK NG v4.1.0 was released on September 4, 2020.

#### New features

**Screenshot capture**

v4.1.0 adds the `getCurrentFrameData` method which gets the data of the video frame being rendered.

**Audio playback device management**

v4.1.0 adds the following APIs to manage audio playback devices:

- `setPlaybackDevice`: Sets the audio playback device, for example, the speaker. This method supports Chrome only.
- `getPlaybackDevices`: Retrieves the audio playback devices available.
- `onPlaybackDeviceChanged`: Occurs when an audio playback device is added or removed.

#### Improvements

- Fully supports Chromium-based versions of Microsoft Edge (versions 80 and later).
- Improves the accuracy of the `network-quality` event.
- Supports sharing audio when sharing Chrome tabs on macOS.

#### Fixed issues

- Information retrieved by `checkVideoTrackIsActive` on Safari is inaccurate.
- Occasional failure of reconnection after enabling dual-stream mode.
- Occasional failure to call `setEnabled` after leaving the channel.
- Failure to push streams to CDN with transcoding and without transcoding at the same time.
- Occasional failure to automatically re-subscribe to the remote streams after disconnection, indicated by the `UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE: ERR_SUBSCRIBE_REQUEST_INVALID` error.
- Failure to join different channels with the same UID in one browser tab.
- Occasional misreport on connection states due to frequent channel join and leave.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `LocalVideoTrack.getCurrentFrameData`
- `RemoteVideoTrack.getCurrentFrameData`
- `AgoraRTC.getPlaybackDevices`
- `LocalAudioTrack.setPlaybackDevice`
- `RemoteAudioTrack.setPlaybackDevice`
- `AgoraRTC.onPlaybackDeviceChanged`
- `Client.getLocalAudioStats`
- `Client.getRemoteAudioStats`
- `Client.getLocalVideoStats`
- `Client.getRemoteVideoStats`

**Deprecated**

- The `LocalTrack.getStats` and `RemoteTrack.getStats` methods. Use the `Client.getLocalAudioStats`, `Client.getRemoteAudioStats`, `Client.getLocalVideoStats` and `Client.getRemoteVideoStats` methods instead.

## v4.0.1

Agora Web SDK NG v4.0.1 was released on July 18, 2020. This release fixed the following issues:
- Failure to publish local tracks on Chrome 70.
- Publish operation may not be aborted when leaving the channel.

## v4.0.0

Agora Web SDK NG v4.0.0 was released on July 15, 2020.

#### Compatibility changes

v4.0.0 deletes the `LocalTrack.setMute` method and adds the `LocalTrack.setEnabled` method for enabling or disabling a local track. The advantages of this change are as follows:

- Eliminates the concept of "mute" to avoid confusion between mute states and publishing states.
  - In versions earlier than v4.0.0, the SDK triggers the `Client.on("user-mute-updated")` callback when the remote user calls `setMute` to change the mute state.
  - As of v4.0.0, the SDK triggers the existing `Client.on("user-unpublished")` or `Client.on("user-published")` callbacks when the remote user calls `setEnabled` to enable or disable a track.
- After you call `setMute(true)`, the SDK sends black video frames or silenced audio frames. If you mute a local video track, the camera light stays on, which might adversely impact the user experience. In contrast, if you disable a local video track by calling `setEnabled(false)`, the SDK immediately turns off the camera and stops capturing video.

> The `setEnabled` method changes media input behaviors, so it is an asynchronous operation and returns the result through the `Promise` object.

#### New features

**Video encoding strategy**

v4.0.0 adds the `optimizationMode` property in the `CameraVideoTrackInitConfig`, `ScreenVideoTrackInitConfig`, and `CustomVideoTrackInitConfig` interfaces. When creating a video track by calling `createCameraVideoTrack`, `createCustomVideoTrack`, or `createScreenVideoTrack`, you can choose whether to prioritize video quality or smoothness by setting optimizationMode as the following:

- `"detail"`: Prioritizes video quality.
  - The SDK ensures high-quality images by automatically calculating a minimum bitrate based on the capturing resolution and frame rate. No matter how poor the network condition is, the sending bitrate will never be lower than the minimum value.
  - In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the sending resolution, but may reduce the frame rate.
-  `"motion"`: Prioritizes video smoothness.
  - In poor network conditions, the SDK reduces the sending bitrate to minimize video freezes.
  - In most cases, the SDK does not reduce the frame rate, but may reduce the sending resolution.

> The  `optimizationMode` property of the video track created by calling createScreenVideoTrack is set as `"detail"` by default.

#### Improvements

- Redesigns the `withAudio` parameter in `AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack`. In addition to `enable` and `disable`, you can also set `withAudio` as `auto`. In this setting, the SDK shares the audio, dependent on whether the browser supports this function. 
- Does not allow setting the `withAudio` parameter as `"all"` any more to avoid code repetition. As of v4.0.0, you can only set `withAudio` as `"audio"` or `"video"`. This change involves the following APIs:
  - The `Client.subscribe` method.
  - The `Client.on("user-published")` and `Client.on("user-unpublished")` callbacks.

#### Fixed issues

v4.0.0 fixed the following issues:

- After the local user called `unpublish`, the SDK triggerred the `Client.on("user-left")` callback on the remote side.
- Periodic video blur when sharing the screen in `"rtc"` mode.
- Occasional publishing failure when calling `publish` and `unpublish` frequently.
- The `Client.on("network-quality")` callback was inaccurate.

#### API changes

**Added**

- The `Client.localTracks` interface
- The `LocalTrack.setEnabled` method
- The `optimizationMode` property in `CameraVideoTrackInitConfig, ``ScreenVideoTrackInitConfig`, and `CustomVideoTrackInitConfig` interfaces

**Updated**

- Adds the value of `auto` to the withAudio parameter in `AgoraRTC.createScreenVideoTrack`.
- Removes the value of `"all"` from the mediaType parameter in `Client.subscribe`.
- The `mediaType` parameter in the `Client.on("user-published")` and `Client.on("user-unpublished")` callbacks does report `"all"`

**Deprecated**

- The `LocalAudioTrackStats.muteState` property
- The `LocalVideoTrackStats.muteState` property
- The `RemoteAudioTrackStats.muteState` property
- The `RemoteVideoTrackStats.muteState` property

**Deleted**

- The `Client.on("user-mute-updated")` callback
- The `LocalTrack.setMute` method
- The `AgoraRTCRemoteUser.audioMuted` property
- The `AgoraRTCRemoteUser.videoMuted` property
- The `LocalTrack.getUserId` method
