## Description

In real-time scenarios requiring high quality, conducting tests before joining a channel helps troubleshoot in advance and improve the overall user experience. You can perform the following pre-call tests:

- Network test: Detects the network quality by probing the uplink and downlink last-mile network quality.
- Device test: Checks if the local audio recording and playback devices work properly.

This article describes how to implement these tests.

## Sample project

Agora provides an open-source sample project that implements [pre-call tests](https://github.com/AgoraIO/API-Examples/blob/master/Android/APIExample/app/src/main/java/io/agora/api/example/examples/advanced/PreCallTest.java) on GitHub. You can download the sample project to try it out or refer to the source code.

## Network probe test

As of v2.4.0, the Agora RTC Native SDK provides the `startLastmileProbeTest` method that probes the last-mile network before joining a channel and returns statistics about the network quality, including round-trip latency, packet loss rate, and network bandwidth.

### Implementation 

Before proceeding, ensure that you have implemented basic real-time functions in your project. See [Start a Call](./start_call_android?platform=Android) or [Start Interactive Live Streaming](./start_live_android?platform=Android).

Refer to the following steps to implement the network probe test:

1. Call the `startLastmileProbeTest` to start the network probe test before joining a channel or switching the user role. You need to specify the expected upstream and downstream bitrate in this method.
2.  After the method call, the SDK triggers the following callbacks:
- `onLastmileQuality`: Triggered two seconds after the `startLastmileProbeTest` method is called. This callback rates the network conditions with a score and is more closely linked to the user experience.
- `onLastmileProbeResult`: Triggered 30 seconds after the `startLastmileProbeTest` method is called. This callback returns the real-time statistics of the network conditions and is more objective.
3. After getting the network quality statistics, call the `stopLastmileProbeTest` method to stop the last-mile network probe test.

The API call sequence is as follows:

### Sample code

Refer to the following code to implement the last-mile test in your project.

```java
// Configure a LastmileProbeConfig instance.
LastmileProbeConfig config = new LastmileProbeConfig(){};
// Probe the uplink network quality.
config.probeUplink =  true;
// Probe the downlink network quality.
config.probeDownlink = true;
// The expected uplink bitrate (bps). The value range is [100000,5000000].
config.expectedUplinkBitrate = 100000;
// The expected downlink bitrate (bps). The value range is [100000,5000000].
config.expectedDownlinkBitrate = 100000;
// Start the last-mile network test before joining the channel.
rtcEngine.startLastmileProbeTest(config);

// Implemented in the global IRtcEngineEventHandler class.
// Triggered 2 seconds after starting the last-mile test.
public void onLastmileQuality(int quality)

// Implemented in the global IRtcEngineEventHandler class.
// Triggered 30 seconds after starting the last-mile test.
public void onLastmileProbeResult(LastmileProbeResult) {
	// (1) Stop the test. Agora recommends not calling any other API method before the test ends.
	rtcEngine.stopLastmileProbeTest();
}

// (2) Stop the test in an alternate place. Agora recommends not calling any other API method before the test ends.
rtcEngine.stopLastmileProbeTest();
```

## Device test

As of v2.4.0, the Agora RTC Native SDK provides the `startEchoTest` method that tests whether the network connection and the audio devices, such as the microphone and the speakers, are working properly.

## Implementation

Before proceeding, ensure that you have implemented basic real-time functions in your project. See [Start a Call](./start_call_android?platform=Android) or [Start Interactive Live Streaming](./start_live_android?platform=Android).

1. Call `startEchoTest` before joining a channel. You need to set the `intervalInSeconds` parameter in this method to notify the SDK when to report the result of this test. The value range is [2,10], and the default value is 10 (in seconds).

2. When the echo test starts, let the user speak for a while. If the recording plays back within the set time interval, the audio devices and the network connection are working properly.

3. Once you get the test result, call `stopEchoTest` to stop the current test before joining a channel using `joinChannel`.

### Sample code

```java
// Start the echo test. 
// Set the time interval between when you speak and when the recording plays back as 10 seconds.
rtcEngine.startEchoTest(10);

// Wait and check if the user can hear the recorded audio.

// Stop the echo test.
rtcEngine.stopEchoTest();
```

## Considerations

- Calling `startLastmileProbeTest` for pre-call network quality detection consumes network traffic. Therefore, after calling this method, Agora recommends not calling any other method until you receive the `onLastmileProbeResult` callback.
- The `onLastmileQuality` callback may return `UNKNOWN` the first time it is triggered. Subsequent callbacks will return the test results.
- When conducting the last-mile probe test, the voice SDK uses a fixed bitrate of 48 Kbps. The video SDK adjusts the actual bitrate according to the video profile.
- In an interactive live streaming channel, only a host can call `startEchoTest`.
- Once the echo test ends, you must call `stopEchoTest` to stop it. Otherwise, you cannot conduct another echo test or join a call using `joinChannel`.
