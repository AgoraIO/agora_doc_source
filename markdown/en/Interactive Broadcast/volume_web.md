## Introduction
The Agora RTC SDK enables you to manage the volume of the recorded audio or of the audio playback according to your actual scenario. For example, to mute a remote user in a one-to-one call, you can set the audio playback volume as 0.
## Implementation
BeforeÂ adjusting the audio volume, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication functions in your project. For details, see [Start a Call](start_call_web) or [Start a Live Broadcast](start_live_web).

### Adjust the Playout Volume

```
 client.on("stream-subscribed", function(evt){
  var stream = evt.stream;
  // Sets the volume of the remote stream to 50.
  stream.setAudioVolume(50);
 });
```

### Mute the Remote User

```
 client.on("stream-subscribed", function(evt){
  var stream = evt.stream;
  // Mutes the remote stream.
  stream.setAudioVolume(0);
 });
```

## Considerations

- If the volume is set too high, noise may occur on some devices.
