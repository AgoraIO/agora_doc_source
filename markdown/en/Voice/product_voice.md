# Agora Voice Overview

## Introduction

Agora Voice is a calling system, providing reliable real-time audio services, making real-time audio available everywhere. It is based on the UDP protocol and Agora sound codec technology.

Agora Voice SDK uses uses Agoraâ€™s global SD-RTN deployment to provide:

-   End-to-end delay of less than 76ms

-   99.9% connectivity rate

-   99.99% high availability

-   Excellent anti-lost technology

## Supported Platform

-   iOS

-   Android

-   Windows

-   macOS

-   Linux

-   Web

-   Wechat

Agora Voice supports real-time voice interaction for up to 7 people within the same channel with the following voice capabilities:

 -   3A audio algorithm \(echo cancellation, auto gain, noise suppression\)

 -   Full-band audio sampling with sampling rate of up to 48 KHz

 -   2-channel stereo audio effect

 -   Spatial sound effect

 -   Audio codec optimization for calls, music, and games

 -   Sound mixing
