<div class="alert info">If you need to integrate SDK with versions earlier than v3.2.0, see integration steps in <a href="#earlierversion">Integrate earlier versions of the SDK</a>.</div>

### Method 1: Through CocoaPods

1. Ensure that you have installed CocoaPods before the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

3. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project.

```
# platform :macOS, '10.11' use_frameworks!
target 'Your App' do
  pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_macOS'
end
```

4. Return to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.

### Method 2: Through the Agora website

1. Navigate to [SDK Downloads](./downloads?platform=macOS), download the latest version of the Agora macOS SDK, and extract the files from the downloaded SDK package.

2. According to your requirements, copy the libraries from the `libs` folder of the SDK to the `./project_name` folder in your project (`project_name` is an example of your project name).

 <div class="alert note">The libraries with the <code>Extension</code> suffix are optional. Add the corresponding libraries according to your needs. For the feature of each extension library, see <a href="./release_mac_video?platform=macOS">Release Notes</a >.</div>

3. Open Xcode, and navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.

4. Click **+** > **Add Otherâ€¦** > **Add Files** to add the cooresponding libraries. Ensure that the **Embed** attribute of these dynamic libraries is **Embed & Sign**.

  <div class="alert note"><ul><li>According to the official requirements of Apple, the Extension of an app cannot contain the dynamic library. If you need to integrate the SDK with the dynamic library in the Extension, change the file status to <b>Do Not Embed</b>.</li><li>The Agora SDK uses libc++ (LLVM) by default. Contact support@agora.io if you want to use libstdc++ (GNU). The SDK provides FAT image libraries with multi-architecture support for both 32/64-bit audio emulators and 32/64-bit audio/video real devices.</li></ul></div>

## Implement the basic call

This section introduces how to use the Agora Voice SDK to make a voice call. The following figure shows the API call sequence of a basic one-to-one voice call.
![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1584694780347)

### 1. Create the UI

Create the user interface (UI) for the one-to-one call in your project. Skip to [Import the class](#ImportClass) if you already have a UI in your project.

When you are implementing a voice call, we recommend adding the following elements into the UI:	
- The voice call window
- The end-call button

When you use the UI setting of the demo project, you can see the following interface:

![](https://web-cdn.agora.io/docs-files/1584695092619)

### <a name="ImportClass"></a> 2. Import the class

Import the `AgoraRtcKit` class in your project.

```objective-c
// Objective-C
// As of v3.0.0, the SDK uses the AgoraRtcKit object.
#import <AgoraRtcKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h>
// The SDK of a version earlier than v3.0.0 uses the AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
#import <AgoraRtcEngineKit/AgoraRtcEngineKit.h>
```

```swift
// Swift
// As of v3.0.0, the SDK uses the AgoraRtcKit object.
import AgoraRtcKit
// The SDK of a version earlier than v3.0.0 uses the AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
import AgoraRtcEngineKit
```

<div class="alert note">The Agora Native SDK uses libc++ (LLVM) by default. Contact Agora support If you want to use libstdc++ (GNU). The SDK provides FAT image libraries with multi-architecture support for both 32/64-bit audio emulators and 32/64-bit voice real devices.</div>

### 3. Initialize AgoraRtcEngineKit

Create and initialize the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object before calling any other Agora APIs.

Call the `sharedEngineWithAppId` method and pass in the App ID to initialize the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object.

You can also listen for callback events, such as when the remote user joins or leaves the channel. 

```objective-c
// Objective-C
- (void)initializeAgoraEngine {
    // Input your App ID to initialize the AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
    self.agoraKit = [AgoraRtcEngineKit sharedEngineWithAppId:appID delegate:self];
}
```

```swift
// Swift
func initializeAgoraEngine() {
   // Initialize the AgoraRtcEngineKit object.
   agoraKit = AgoraRtcEngineKit.sharedEngine(withAppId: AppID, delegate: self)
}
```

### 4. Join a channel

After initializing the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` object, you can call the `joinChannelByToken` method to join a channel. In this method, set the following parameters:

- `channelId`: Specify the channel name that you want to join. Input your `channelId` before running the sample code.

- `token`: Pass a token that identifies the role and privilege of the user. You can set it as one of the following values:
  - `nil`.
  - A temporary token generated in Console. A temporary token is valid for 24 hours. For details, see [Get a Temporary Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token#get-a-temporary-token).
  - A token generated at the server. This applies to scenarios with high-security requirements. For details, see [Generate a token from Your Server](./token_server).

  <div class="alert note">If your project has enabled the app certificate, ensure that you provide a token.</div>

- `uid`: ID of the local user that is an integer and should be unique. If you set `uid` as 0,  the SDK assigns a user ID for the local user and returns it in the `joinSuccessBlock` callback.
 
 <div class="alert note">Once the user joins the channel, the user subscribes to the audio streams of all the other users in the channel by default, giving rise to usage and billing calculation. If you do not want to subscribe to a specified stream or all remote streams, call the <tt>mute</tt> methods accordingly.</div>
 
- `joinSuccessBlock`: Returns that the user joins the specified channel. It is same as `didJoinChannel`. We recommend setting `joinSuccessBlock` as `nil`, so that the SDK can trigger the `didJoinChannel` callback.

For more details on the parameter settings, see [joinChannelByToken](./API%20Reference/oc/Classes/AgoraRtcEngineKit.html#//api/name/joinChannelByToken:channelId:info:uid:joinSuccess:).

```objective-c
// Objective-C
- (void)joinChannel {
    // Join a channel with a token.
    [self.agoraKit joinChannelByToken:token channelId:@"demoChannel1" info:nil uid:0 joinSuccess:^(NSString *channel, NSUInteger uid, NSInteger elapsed) {
    }];
}
```

```swift
// Swift
func joinChannel() {
    // Join a channel with a token.
    agoraKit.joinChannel(byToken: Token, channelId: "demoChannel1", info:nil, uid:0) { [unowned self] (channel, uid, elapsed) -> Void in}
    self.logVC?.log(type: .info, content: "did join channel")
    }
    isStartCalling = true
}
```

### 5. Leave the channel

Call the `leaveChannel` method to leave the current call according to your scenario, for example, when the call ends, when you need to close the app, or when your app runs in the background.

```objective-c
// Objective-C
- (void)leaveChannel {
    // Leave the channel.
    [self.agoraKit leaveChannel:^(AgoraChannelStats *stat)
}
```

```
// Swift
func leaveChannel() {
// Leave the channel.
 AgoraKit.leaveChannel(nil)
 AgoraKit = nil
 view.window!.close()
 }
```

## Run the project

Before running the project, you need to set your signing and team, and add device permissions.

### 1. Set your signing and team

1. In Xcode, navigate to **TARGETS > Project Name > General > Signing**, and choose **Automatically manage signing**.
2. Read the prompts carefully, and click **Enable Automatic**.
3. After you successfully set your signing, choose a developer in **Team**.

### 2. Add device permissions

1. In Xcode, open the `info.plist` file. Add the following contents to add permissions for your device:

 
| Key                                    | Type   | Value                                                        |
| :------------------------------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Privacy - Microphone Usage Description | String | The purpose for accessing the microphone, such as for a call or interactive live streaming. |

 

2. Navigate to **TARGETS** > **Project Name** > **Signing & Capabilities**, and add the following permissions in **App Sandbox** and **Hardened Runtime**:

  
| Capability       | Category        | Permission                                                 |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| App Sandbox      | Network         | <ul><li>Incoming Connections (Server)</li><li>Outgoing Connections (Client)</li></ul> |
| App Sandbox      | Hardware        | Audio Input                                          |
| Hardened Runtime | Resource Access | Audio Input                                          |

 <div class="alert note"><ul><li>If you need to add a third-party plug-in or library, and the signing of the third-party plug-in or library is different from your project, you need to navigate to <b>Hardened Runtime</b> > <b>Runtime Exceptions</b>, and check the <b>Disable Library Validation</b> option.</li><li>See more considerations in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing_your_app_for_distribution">Preparing Your App for Distribution</a >.</li></ul></div>
 
 
 
3. In Xcode 12.2 and later, to avoid compliation errors, you need to navigate to **TARGETS** > **Project Name** > **Build Settings** > **Architectures**, and set the **Architectures** property to **x86_64** before the compilation.

### 3. Try a voice call

In Xcode, connect to your macOS device, and click the **Build** button on the upper left corner. If your app is installed and running successfully, you should see the window for a voice call.

To test the remote audio, visit the [Web Demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/agora-web-showcase/examples/Agora-Web-Tutorial-1to1-Web/), then enter the same App ID, channel name, and token to join the same channel. When you successfully start a one-to-one voice call in the app, you should hear remote users.

## <a name="earlierversion"></a>Integrate earlier versions of the SDK

Choose one of the following methods to integrate a version of the Agora macOS SDK earlier than v3.2.0.

### Method 1: Through CocoaPods

1. Ensure that you have installed CocoaPods before performing the following steps. See the installation guide in [Getting Started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. In Terminal, navigate to the project path, and run the `pod init` command to create a `Podfile` in the project folder.

 
3. Open the `Podfile`, delete all contents, and input the following codes. Remember to replace `Your App` with the target name of your project and replace `version` with the version of the SDK that you want to integrate. For information about the SDK version, see [Release Notes](./release_mac_audio?platform=macOS).



 ```
# platform :macOS, '10.11' use_frameworks!
target 'Your App' do
  pod 'AgoraRtcEngine_macOS', 'version'
end
```

4. Return to Terminal, and run the `pod install` command to install the Agora SDK. Once you successfully install the SDK, it shows `Pod installation complete!` in Terminal, and you can see an `xcworkspace` file in the project folder.

5. Open the generated `xcworkspace` file.

### Method 2: Through your local storage

You need to use different integration methods to integrate different versions of the SDK. Click the following version categories to expand the corresponding integration steps.
