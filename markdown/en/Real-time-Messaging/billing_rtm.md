This article introduces the billing policy for the Agora Real-time Messaging (RTM) service provided by Agora.

<p><div class="alert note">Your billing details may differ if you have signed a contract with Agora.</div></p>

## Overview

Billing for the RTM service begins once you implement the real-time messaging function using the Agora RTC SDK. Agora calculates the billing of all projects under your Agora account monthly. For details, see [Billing, fee deduction, and account suspension](/en/faq/billing_account).

## Calculation

For each RTM project, Agora calculates your monthly billing based on the highest number of daily active users (DAUs) of the month.

## Pricing

<p><div class="alert note">For each RTM project, Agora reduces the highest number of DAUs of the month by 1,000 before calculating the billing. Thus, the price is 0 for the number </div></p>

|  Highest number of DAUs of the month   | Price ($/1,000 users) |
