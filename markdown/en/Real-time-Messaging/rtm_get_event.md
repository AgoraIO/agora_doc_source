<div class="alert note">qps of the RESTful APIs: 100 (for each vendor).</div>


## <a name="auth"></a>Authentication

Agora RTM RESTful API supports HTTPS only. You can use either of the following methods to authenticate your HTTP request: 

- [Basic authentication](#basicauth)
- [Token authentication](#tokenauth)

### <a name="basicauth"></a>Basic authentication

You need to pass the basic HTTP authentication and put `api_key:api_secret` in the `Authorization` field of the HTTP header. For more information on how to generate the `Authorization` filed, see [RESTful API authentication](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/restful_authentication).

### <a name="tokenauth"></a>Token authentication

If you have already generated an RTM Token on your server, you can use token authentication. You need to put the following information to the `x-agora-token` field and the `x-agora-uid` field when sending your HTTP request: 

- The RTM Token generated at your server. 
- The uid you use to generate the RTM Token. 

For more information on how to generate the `x-agora-token` field and the `x-agora-uid` field, see [RESTful API authentication](https://docs.agora.io/en/faq/restful_authentication).

> - The RTM backend stores a maximum of 2,000 events. 
> - The backend returns a maximum of 1,000 events each time. 
> - We do not guarantee the time sequence of events across geographies, because we store events by regions. 
> - If you have pulled events from one region, you may get the same events when you pull from a different region. This is because we only synchronize events within a region and do not synchronize events across regions.
