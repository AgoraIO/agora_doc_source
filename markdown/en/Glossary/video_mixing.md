Video mixing means combining multiple video streams into one. Common scenarios of video mixing include:

- When pushing streams to CDN for multiple hosts in a channel, developers need to combine the video screens of multiple hosts into one.
- In composite recording mode, the video screen of the recorded video combines the screens of all or specified users.
