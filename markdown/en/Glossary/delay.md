In real-time audio and video communication, delay refers to the time elapsed from when the data is sent to when it is received.

Since real-time audio and video communication simulates speaking to another person directly, delay greatly affects the user's communication experience. Generally speaking, the shorter the delay, the better the communication experience.

The most critical factor for delay is the routing of data from the sender to the receiver. The Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ network has nodes covering more than 200 regions worldwide, and it uses intelligent dynamic routing algorithms to reduce delays.
