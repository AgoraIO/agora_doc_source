The SDK applies different optimization methods according to the channel profile. Agora supports the following channel  profiles:

| Channel profile | Description | 
| ---------------- | ---------------- | 
| Communication     | One-on-one or group calls, where all users in the channel can talk freely.    | 
| Live Broadcast     | In a live broadcast channel, users have two client roles: [Host](#host) and [audience](#audience). The host sends and receives audio/video, and the audience receives audio/video with the sending function disabled.   | 
| Gaming    | Any user in the channel can talk freely. This profile uses the codec with low-power consumption and low bitrate by default.   | 

<div class="alert note">The gaming profile applies to the Agora Gaming SDK only.</div>
