In scenarios where multiple users engage in real-time audio and video communication, user experience can be impaired if the network condition is too poor to guarantee both audio and video at the same time.

Stream fallback minimizes the impact of poor network connections by ensuring that some form of communication continues between the sender and receiver. Audio and video streams change to audio-only, or from high-quality to low-quality video.

If the network connection improves, the low-quality video stream or audio-only stream return to the original quality.
