Agora provides the Agora RTC (Real-time Communication) SDK for enabling real-time audio and video communications. By integrating the Agora RTC SDK, developers can add voice call, video call, audio broadcast, and video broadcast functions in their projects.

Based on the different functions and platforms, the RTC SDK is also categorized as follows:

| SDK | Platform | Feature |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Voice SDK      | <ul><li>Native: Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows</li><li>Third-party framework: Unity</li></ul>      | <ul><li>Voice call</li><li>Audio broadcast</li></ul>      |
| Video SDK     | <ul><li>Native: Android, iOS, macOS, Web, and Windows</li><li>Third-party framework: Unity, Electron, React Native, and Flutter</li></ul>    | <ul><li>Voice call</li><li>Audio broadcast</li><li>Audio and video call</li><li>Audio and video broadcast</li></ul> |

RTC SDKs for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows are known as the RTC Native SDK. Agora maintains and releases repositories on GitHub for both [React Native](https://github.com/AgoraIO/React-Native-SDK) and [Flutter](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Flutter-SDK).

In addition to basic real-time audio and video communication, the RTC SDK also supports advanced features such as audio mixing, screen sharing, modifying raw data, using external audio and video data, and pushing streams to the CDN.

Developers can use other Agora SDKs or services to implement the following:

- Enable real-time audio and video recording with the Agora On-premise Recording SDK or Cloud Recording service.
- Enable playback of online media resource playback with the Agora MediaPlayer Kit plug-in.
- Enable real-time messaging or signaling with the Agora RTM SDK.
