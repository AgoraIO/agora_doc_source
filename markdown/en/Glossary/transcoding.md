Transcoding is the process of decoding audio and video data and then re-encoding them into the target conversion output or format. Transcoding may include converting encoding formats (such as H.264 and AAC), encoding attributes (such as sampling rates, code rates, and I-Frame intervals), file encapsulation formats (such as MP4 and TS), and so on.

During a cloud recording or an on-premise recording, multiple scenarios involve transcoding. For example, in composite recording mode, the recording service transcodes audio and video streams in real time to mix multiple streams into one. In individual recoding mode, developers can use transcoding to mix the audio and the video files of one UID into a single audio and video file or to merge slice files into an MP4 file or files in other formats.

RTMP converter: When multiple hosts are in a channel in a live broadcast, Agora servers combine the streams into a single one through transcoding.
