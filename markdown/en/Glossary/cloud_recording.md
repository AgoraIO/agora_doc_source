Cloud Recording is a component provided by Agora for recording and saving voice and video calls and interactive broadcasts on a third-party cloud storage through RESTful APIs.

Developers can quickly and flexibly record one-to-one or one-to-many voice and video calls or interactive broadcasts through integration. Unlike Agora On-premise Recording, Agora Cloud Recording does not require a Linux server. Developers can use Cloud Recording for scenarios such as online classrooms, interactive broadcasts, customer service, and more.

Cloud Recording RESTful APIs are compatible with the Agora RTC SDK. Cloud Recording supports two recording modes: [individual](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_individual_mode) and [composite](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_composite_mode).
