In web page recording mode, the content and audio of a specified web page are recorded in a single file. With web page recording, you can:

- In an online class, record the content of the slides and the whiteboard together with the audio and video of the teacher and the students.
- In a video conference, record the content of the slides and the whiteboard together with the audio and video of all participants.
