In real-time audio and video communication, jitter is the variation in the delay of data packets transmitted continuously on the network.

A major factor behind jitter is that packets are routed individually through different paths in a packet-switched network. 

Jitter often results in packet loss and network congestion. It may result in pixelated video and otherwise adversely impact the end user experience.

The [Agora RTC SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#agora-rtc-sdk) provides API methods for developers to conduct last-mile probe tests before starting a call, which reports the uplink and downlink network jitter.
