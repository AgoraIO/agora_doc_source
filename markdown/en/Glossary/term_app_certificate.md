App Certificate is a random string generated by Agora for enabling token authentication. It is one of the required arguments for generating a token.

Anyone who obtains a developer's App ID and App Certificate, legally or otherwise, can implement real-time audio and video functions in their apps. All the billings and statistics thus generated go to the developer's account. To avoid any possible loss, keep the App Certificate in a safe place. Agora recommends storing the App Certificate on the business sever, not on the client.
