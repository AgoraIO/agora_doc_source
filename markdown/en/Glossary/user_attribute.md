User attributes are tags added to RTM users, including the property name and the property value. Each property name has one and only one property value. The Agora RTM SDK supports adding, deleting, updating, and getting the attributes of local or remote RTM users. For example, the following user attribute describes the gender and age of a user:

```json
{"gender":"male","age":"30"}
```
