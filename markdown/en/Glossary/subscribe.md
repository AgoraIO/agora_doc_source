In the Agora RTC SDK, subscribing is the action of receiving media streams published to the channel. A user can receive other users' audio and/or video data by subscribing to their streams. A user can subscribe to one or more streams published by other users. Developers can either directly play the subscribed streams or process them, for example by taking screenshots, or recording the streams.

In the Agora RTM SDK, subscribing is the action of monitoring the online status of one or multiple RTM users. If the online status of the subscribed RTM user changes, then the Agora RTM SDK informs the subscriber by callback. See <a href="/en/Real-time-Messaging/API%20Reference/RTM_java/index.html#subscribe">Subscribing to or unsubscribing from the online status of specified users</a>.
