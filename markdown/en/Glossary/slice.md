Slicing means cutting recorded audio or video into separate files according to specific rules. During an Agora Cloud Recording, the recording service cuts the streams and generates multiple slice files (TS or WebM files) and M3U8 files that serve as a playlist of the slice files. See [Manage Recorded Files](https://docs.agora.io/en/cloud-recording/cloud_recording_manage_files?platform=All%20Platforms).
