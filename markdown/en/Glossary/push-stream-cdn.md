Pushing streams to CDN (Content Delivery Network),  also called "CDN live streaming", means that the Agora server converts the stream in the RTC channel from the Agora protocol to the standard protocol, and pushes the stream to a third-party CDN.

After pushing the host's stream to a thirty-party CDN, in addition to the audience in the channel, the CDN audience can also watch the live streaming. Pushing streams to CDN can enrich the distribution channels of the live streaming, which is conducive to promoting live streaming.

In a co-hosting scenario, CDN live streaming requires enabling the transcoding function to merge multiple streams into one. The CDN audience can watch the live stream by using the stream's CDN URL.
