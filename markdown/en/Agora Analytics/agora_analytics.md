Agora Analytics is a site for developers to track and analyze the usage and quality of calls.

Agora Analytics provides an intuitive interface where developers can locate quality issues across several dimensions, including call quality, call duration, and other factors. Developers can also discover root causes and fix them to improve user experience.

Agora also provides RESTful APIs for developers to retrieve the statistics of their calls and use the data in their own applications.
