## v4.2.2

v4.2.2 was released on July xx, 2023.

#### New features

1. **Wildcard token**

   This release introduces wildcard tokens. Agora supports setting the channel name used for generating a token as a wildcard character. The token generated can be used to join any channel if you use the same user id. In scenarios involving multiple channels, such as switching between different channels, using a wildcard token can avoid repeated application of tokens every time users joining a new channel, which reduces the pressure on your token server. See [Wildcard Tokens](https://docportal.shengwang.cn/cn/live-streaming-premium-4.x/wildcard_token?platform=All Platforms).

   <div class="alert info">All 4.x SDKs support using wildcard tokens.</div>

2. **Preloading channels**

   This release adds `preloadChannelByToken [1/2]` and `preloadChannelByToken [2/2]` methods, which allows a user whose role is set as audience to preload channels before joining one. Calling the method can help shortening the time of joining a channel, thus reducing the time it takes for audience members to hear and see the host.

   When preloading more than one channels, Agora recommends that you use a wildcard token for preloading to avoid repeated application of tokens every time you joining a new channel, thus saving the time for switching between channels. See [Wildcard Token](https://docportal.shengwang.cn/cn/live-streaming-premium-4.x/wildcard_token?platform=All Platforms).

#### Improvements

**Channel media relay**

The number of target channels for media relay has been increased to 6. When calling `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, you can specify up to 6 target channels.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed slow channel reconnection after the connection was interrupted due to network reasons.

- Occasional crash after calling the `destroyMediaPlayer` method.


## v4.2.0

v4.2.0 was released on May 23, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.

**1. Channel media options**

- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is deleted. Use `publishCustomAudioTrack` instead.
- `publishCustomAudioSourceId` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` is renamed to `publishCustomAudioTrackId`.

**2. Miscellaneous**

- `didApiCallExecute` is deleted. Agora recommends getting the results of the API implementation through relevant channels and media callbacks.
- `startChannelMediaRelay`, `updateChannelMediaRelay`, `startChannelMediaRelayEx` and `updateChannelMediaRelayEx` are deprecated. Use `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` instead.

#### New features

**1. AI noise suppression**

This release introduces the AI noise suppression function. Once enabled, the SDK automatically detects and reduces background noises. Whether in bustling public venues or real-time competitive arenas that demand lightning-fast responsiveness, this function guarantees optimal audio clarity, providing users with an elevated audio experience. You can enable this function through the newly-introduced `setAINSMode` method and set the noise suppression mode as balance, aggressive or low latency according to your scenarios.

**2. Cross-device synchronization**

In real-time collaborative singing scenarios, network issues can cause inconsistencies in the downlinks of different client devices. To address this, this release introduces `getNtpWallTimeInMs` for obtaining the current Network Time Protocol (NTP) time. By using this method to synchronize lyrics and music across multiple client devices, users can achieve synchronized singing and lyrics progression, resulting in a better collaborative experience.
#### Improvements

**1. Voice changer**

This release introduces the `setLocalVoiceFormant` method that allows you to adjust the formant ratio to change the timbre of the voice. This method can be used together with the `setLocalVoicePitch` method to adjust the pitch and timbre of voice at the same time, enabling a wider range of voice transformation effects.

**2. Channel media relay**

This release introduces `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`, allowing for a simpler and smoother way to start and update media relay across channels. With these methods, developers can easily start the media relay across channels and update the target channels for media relay with a single method. Additionally, the internal interaction frequency has been optimized, effectively reducing latency in function calls.

**3. Custom audio tracks**

To better meet the needs of custom audio capture scenarios, this release adds `createCustomAudioTrack` and `destroyCustomAudioTrack` for creating and destroying custom audio tracks. Two types of audio tracks are also provided for users to choose from, further improving the flexibility of capturing external audio source:

- Mixable audio track: Supports mixing multiple external audio sources and publishing them to the same channel, suitable for multi-channel audio capture scenarios.
- Direct audio track: Only supports publishing one external audio source to a single channel, suitable for low-latency audio capture scenarios.
#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

- When the host frequently switching the user role between broadcaster and audience in a short period of time, the audience members cannot hear the audio of the host.
- Abnormal client status cased by an exception in the `onRemoteAudioStateChanged` callback.
#### API changes

**Added**

- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`
- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `getNtpWallTimeInMs`
- `setAINSMode`
- `createAudioCustomTrack`
- `destroyAudioCustomTrack`
- `AudioTrackConfig`
- `AgoraAudioTrackType`
- `AgoraApplicationScenarioType`
- The `domainLimit` and `autoRegisterAgoraExtensions` members in `AgoraRtcEngineConfig`
- The `channelId` and `uid` parameters in `stateDidChanged` and `informationDidUpdated` callbacks

**Deprecated**

- `startChannelMediaRelay`
- `startChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `updateChannelMediaRelay`
- `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `didReceiveChannelMediaRelayEvent`
- `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEvent`

**Deleted**

- `didApiCallExecute`
- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions` in `AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions`
## v4.1.1

v4.1.1 was released on January xx, 2023.


#### New features

**Instant frame rendering**

This release adds the `enableInstantMediaRendering` method to enable instant rendering mode for audio frames, which can speed up the first audio frame rendering after the user joins the channel.


#### Issues fixed

- This release fixed the issue that playing audio files with a sample rate of 48 kHz failed.
- At the moment when a user left a channel, a request for leaving was not sent to the server and the leaving behavior was incorrectly determined by the server as timed out.


#### API changes

**Added**

- `enableInstantMediaRendering`


## v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on November xx, 2022.

#### New features

**1. Headphone equalization effect**

This release adds the `setHeadphoneEQParameters` method, which is used to adjust the low- and high-frequency parameters of the headphone EQ. This is mainly useful in spatial audio scenarios. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call setHeadphoneEQParameters to adjust the EQ.

**2. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.

> To enable this feature, contact [sales-us@agora.io](sales-us@agora.io).

**3. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel related methods that you can call to manage audio streams in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `muteLocalAudioStreamEx` method is used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio stream, respectively.
- The `muteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` is used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio streams, respectively.
- The `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `startRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `updateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `stopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `pauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `resumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `stopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- Adds the `leaveChannelEx` [2/2] method. Compared with the `leaveChannelEx` [1/2] method, a new `options` parameter is added, which is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.

**4. Client role switching**

In order to enable users to know whether the switched user role is low-latency or ultra-low-latency, this release adds the `newRoleOptions` parameter to the `didClientRoleChanged` callback. The value of this parameter is as follows:

- `AgoraAudienceLatencyLevelLowLatency` (1): Low latency.
- `AgoraAudienceLatencyLevelUltraLowLatency` (2): Ultra-low latency.

#### Improvements

**1. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v4.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `AgoraChannelMediaRelayEventUpdateDestinationChannelRefused`(8), and you need to call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v4.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.

**2. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.

#### **Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `AgoraAudioScenarioMeeting` scenario.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.

#### **Issues fixed**

This release fixed the following issues:

- Calling `startAudioMixing` to play music files in the `ipod-library://item` path failed.
- Audience members heard buzzing noises when the host switched between speakers and earphones during live streaming.
- Different timestamps for audio data were obtained simultaneously and separately via `onRecordAudioFrame` callbacks.
- The call `getExtensionProperty` failed and returned an empty string.
