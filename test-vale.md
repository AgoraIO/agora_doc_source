The [sdk-name] enables you to develop rapidly to enhance your social, work, education, and IoT apps with real-time engagements.

This page shows the minimum code you need to add [feature] into your app by using the [sdk-name] for [platform].

You need to use different integration methods to integrate different versions of the SDK.

1. According to your requirements, choose one of the following methods to copy the `AgoraRtcKit.framework`, `Agorafdkaac.framework`, <ph props="video live lives">`Agoraffmpeg.framework`, </ph>and `AgoraSoundTouch.framework` dynamic libraries to the `./project_name` folder in your project (`project_name` is an example of your project name):

<ul>
<li>If you do not need to use a simulator to run the project, copy the above dynamic libraries under the path of <code>./libs</code> in the SDK package.</li>
<li>If you need to use a simulator to run the project, copy the above dynamic libraries under the path of <code>./libs/ALL_ARCHITECTURE</code> in the SDK package. The dynamic libraries under this path contains the x86-64 architecture, you need to remove the x86-64 architecture in the libraries before uploading the app to the App Store.
In Terminal, run the following command to remove the x86-64 architecture. Remember to replace <code>ALL_ARCHITECTURE/AgoraRtcKit.framework/AgoraRtcKit</code> with the path of the dynamic library in your project.
<pre>lipo -remove x86-64 ALL_ARCHITECTURE/AgoraRtcKit.framework/AgoraRtcKit -output ALL_ARCHITECTURE/AgoraRtcKit.framework/AgoraRtcKit</pre>
</li>
</ul>
