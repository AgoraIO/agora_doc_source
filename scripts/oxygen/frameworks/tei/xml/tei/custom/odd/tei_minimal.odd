      <head>A Minimal TEI Customization</head>
      
      <p>This TEI ODD defines a TEI customization that is as minimal as possible and the schema generated from it will validate
        a document that is minimally valid against the TEI scheme. It includes only the ten required elements:
        <list rend="numbered">
          <item><gi>teiHeader</gi> from the header module to store required metadata</item>
          <item><gi>fileDesc</gi> from the header module to record information about this file</item>
          <item><gi>titleStmt</gi> from the header module to record information about the title</item>
          <item><gi>publicationStmt</gi> from the header module to detail how it is published</item>
          <item><gi>sourceDesc</gi> from the header module to record where it is from</item>
          <item><gi>p</gi> from the core module for use in the header and the body</item>
          <item><gi>title</gi> from the core module for use in the titleStmt</item>
          <item><gi>TEI</gi> from the textstructure module because what is a TEI file without that?</item>
          <item><gi>text</gi> from the textstructure module to hold some text</item>
          <item><gi>body</gi> from the textstructure module as a place to put that text</item>
        </list>
      </p>
      <schemaSpec ident="tei_minimal" start="TEI">
        
        <!-- required minimal header elements -->
        <moduleRef key="header" include="teiHeader fileDesc titleStmt publicationStmt sourceDesc"/>
        
        <!-- required core elements (p and title for use in titleStmt) -->
        <moduleRef key="core" include="p title"/>
