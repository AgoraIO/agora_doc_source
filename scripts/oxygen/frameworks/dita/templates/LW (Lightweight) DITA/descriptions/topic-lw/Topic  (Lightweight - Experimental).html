  The DITA Lightweight Topic document type is a standard for expressing simplified
  DITA documents in XML, HTML5, and Markdown formats. It uses a subset of the regular
  DITA <i>topic</i> element types and this subset was carefully chosen to include only
  the most basic constructions that are needed to structure information
  effectively.
