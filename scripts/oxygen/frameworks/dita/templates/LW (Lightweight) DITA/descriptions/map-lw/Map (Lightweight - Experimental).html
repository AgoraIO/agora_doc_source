  The DITA Lightweight Map document type is a simplified version of the regular DITA
  Map document type. It uses a subset of the regular DITA <i>map</i> element types to
  organize Lightweight DITA topics and other resources into a hierarchical structure and
  provide the context for how keys are defined and resolved.
