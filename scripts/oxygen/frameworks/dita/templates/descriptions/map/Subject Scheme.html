  The DITA Subject Scheme Map document type is used to define controlled values and
  subject definitions. The controlled values can be bound to attributes, as well as
  element and attribute pairs. The subject definitions can contain metadata and provide
  links to more detailed information, and they can be used to classify content and
  provide semantics that can be used in taxonomies and ontologies.
