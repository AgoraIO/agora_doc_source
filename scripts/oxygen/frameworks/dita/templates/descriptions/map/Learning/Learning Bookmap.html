  The DITA Learning Bookmap document type is similar to the normal DITA Bookmap but is
  used in the Learning and Training specialization. Bookmaps consist of references to
  topics organized as book content and the topic references are labeled according to the
  book components they point to, such as <i>booktitle</i>, <i>frontmatter</i>,
  <i>chapter</i>, and <i>appendix</i>.
