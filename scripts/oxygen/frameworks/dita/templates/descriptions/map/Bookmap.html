  The DITA Bookmap document type is a map specialization used to describe the
  relationships among a set of DITA topics intended to be configured as a traditional
  book. Specifically, bookmaps consist of references to topics organized as book content
  and the topic references are labeled according to the book components they point to,
  such as <i>booktitle</i>, <i>frontmatter</i>, <i>chapter</i>, and
  <i>appendix</i>.
