  The DITA Learning Assessment topic type presents questions or interactions that
  measure progress, encourage recollection, and stimulate reinforcement of learning
  content, and can be presented before the content as a pre-assessment or as a
  post-assessment test. The interactions use a subset of the Question-Test
  Interoperability (QTI) specification, implemented as a DITA domain
  specialization.
