  The DITA Topic document type provides a generic and lenient structure for DITA
  content. It is the base DITA topic type from which all other specializations are
  derived. It is often preferred when the content or desired output doesn't fit one of
  the more restrictive DITA information types or for those who desire a more simplified
  authoring approach.
