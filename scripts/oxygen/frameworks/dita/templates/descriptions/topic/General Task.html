  The DITA General Task topic type provides a less strict task model for
  procedure-oriented information than the strict Task information type. It can serve as
  the base for the strict Task and Machinery Task information types and can be a base
  for new structural specializations. It can also facilitate the migration of legacy
  task content that does not follow the strict models.
