<html><body><h1>wordasword</h1><p> A lot of technical documentation contains words that have
     overloaded meanings.  Sometimes it is useful to be able to use a word without invoking its
     technical meaning.  The <a href="https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/wordasword.html" shape="rect"><code class="sgmltag-element">WordAsWord</code></a> element identifies a word or phrase that might otherwise be
     interpreted in some specific way, and asserts that it should be interpreted simply as a word.
