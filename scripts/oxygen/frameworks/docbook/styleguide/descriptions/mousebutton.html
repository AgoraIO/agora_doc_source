     The <a href="https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/mousebutton.html" shape="rect"><code class="sgmltag-element">MouseButton</code></a> element
     identifies the conventional name of a mouse button.  Because mouse buttons are not physically
     labelled, the name is just that, a convention.  Adding explicit markup for the naming of mouse
     buttons allow easier translation from one convention to another and might allow an online
     system to adapt to right- or left-handed usage. </p></body></html>
