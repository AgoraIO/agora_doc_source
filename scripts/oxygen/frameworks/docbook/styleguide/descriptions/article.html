<html><body><h1>article</h1><p> The
      <a href="https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/article.html" shape="rect"><code class="sgmltag-element">Article</code></a> element is a
     general-purpose container for articles.  The content model is both quite complex and rather
     loose in order to accommodate the wide range of possible <a href="https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/article.html" shape="rect"><code class="sgmltag-element">Article</code></a> structures.  Although changes to the <a href="https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/article.html" shape="rect"><code class="sgmltag-element">Article</code></a> element have been
     discussed on several occasions, no better model has been presented. </p></body></html>
