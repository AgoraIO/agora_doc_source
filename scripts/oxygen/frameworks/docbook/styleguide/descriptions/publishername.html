<html><body><h1>publishername</h1><p> A <a href="https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.0/publishername.html" shape="rect"><code class="sgmltag-element">PublisherName</code></a> is the name of a publisher. Historically, this has been used in
     bibliographic meta-information to identify the publisher of  a book or other document. It is
     also reasonable to identify the publisher of an electronic publication in this way. </p></body></html>
