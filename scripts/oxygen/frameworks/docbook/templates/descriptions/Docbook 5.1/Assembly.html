  The DocBook Assembly template type serves a similar purpose as a DITA map. It is
  used to define the hierarchy and relationships for a collection of resources. It is
  especially helpful for topic-oriented authoring scenarios since it assembles a set of
  resources (such as DocBook Topics) to form a hierarchical structure for a larger
  publication.
