Michael Ferguson, INRS-Telecommunications (mjf) June 1988
Justin Bur, Universite de Montreal (jbb; checked against original list)
all patterns including apostrophe missing from nb list
after that, GUTenberg  and specially Daniel Flipo and Bernard Gaulle
did their best effort to improve the list of patterns.



Adaption of these patterns for
- TeX Version 3.x and MLTeX 3.x (2.x)
and
- all fonts in T1/`Cork' and/or CM/OT1 encoding
by Bernd Raichle 1996/08/28 (using ideas from `ghyph31.tex'
as of 1994-02-13 maintained by Bernd Raichle).
(An adaption for the old MLTeX 2.x exists but can not be
tested in lack of an executable.)
